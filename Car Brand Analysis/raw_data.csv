0,"November 13, 2004 6:48PM",Mr_Shiftright,"okay, whaddya think about this for $1,000? (i'll vote last--i get to be the tie breaker if necessary)

http://www.craigslist.org/sby/car/48503724.html"
1,"November 13, 2004 7:53PM",fintail,"save the useful trim pieces and obscure bits

junk the shell/chassis if no rodder etc wants it, it's a sad looking sedan, no upside, nobody will ever want to restore it."
2,"November 13, 2004 9:36PM",andre1969,"because i kinda like those things. the body actually doesn't look half bad. heck, i've seen rustier cars where the seller would try to pass it off as ""rust free""! ;-)

now i wouldn't put any serious money into it, but i'd say slap a starter on it, and a fresh coat of paint, and have fun with it for awhile, and then move on to something nicer. of course, i'm also not about to offer up $1000 either, so i'm not putting my money where my mouth is!"
3,"November 14, 2004 8:26AM",Mr_Shiftright,"c'mon andre, you're not following the rules (bad dog!). you have to pay the asking price, so what's your vote if this car costs you $1,000?

vote so far

junk/scrap/part out 1
undecided 1"
4,"November 14, 2004 10:30AM",andre1969,"that i think it should be saved, but i'm not gonna be the one to do it! i'm not enough of a '54 plymouth fan to want it, but i just think it's not that far gone that it can't be salvaged by someone who likes them. if i really had a fetish for the '54 plymouth, i'd probably go for it, but it just doesn't excite me.

i guess what i'm getting at is that it's the car more than the condition. if you showed me something that really got me excited, in that condition, at that price, i'd jump on it in a heartbeat."
5,"November 14, 2004 1:33PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well, that's why you vote. you are voting your preference.

so i'm going to count you as a junk/scrap/part out since you won't buy it, okay?

soooo, we have

2 scrap/part out
0 save

so far..."
6,"November 14, 2004 1:55PM",badtoy,"that is the same exact year and model my first wife bought for $40 in ypsilanti, michigan when we first got married. needless to say, we were poor as churchmice, but the big green monster started on those bitter cold mornings when brand new, shiny cars wouldn't -- and was sold to one of our friends who relocated with it to florida, where it is still probably running. well, maybe not -- that was back in 1968.

anyway, for all its basic goodness, it was dowdy, slow, handled like a boat and had almost nothing to recommend it other than the fact that it was cheap and it started like clockwork. i'd pass....

(by the way, you only buy parts for something you intend to restore, so i see no value whatsoever in this car.)"
7,"November 14, 2004 4:23PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well maybe there was a convertible version of this car?? that might be worth restoring if it wasn't too far gone.

okay, so it's

scrap 3 votes
save 0 votes

i'm going to vote scrap it, so that 4-0 and the car loses (4 out of possible 7). reasons are car is of very little collectible value, not very interesting, and pretty far gone for what it is. also overpriced imho by about $750.

okay next car coming up!"
8,"November 14, 2004 4:37PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well a '55 chevy might sound like a no-brainer for salvation, but then we have this one.

http://www.craigslist.org/sby/car/48913766.html

remember you gotta pay the price if you vote save.

whaddya think?"
9,"November 14, 2004 4:49PM",andre1969,"we're gonna run into a problem here, because if voting ""save"" means we're willing to pay the asking price...well who ever pays the asking price?!

at this rate, i think just about every project posted is going to get the junk vote, so this thing is flawed. unless you find some little old lady with a hemi barracuda in her barn that she wants to ditch because she doesn't like the fuel economy, none of these cars are going to be worth their asking price. for instance, just as that '54 savoy is worth saving, so is this '55 chevy. but not for $3000! heck, i'd pay a grand for the savoy before i'd pay 3 grand for this one!

so, just going on asking price, junk it. and put the rims back on the iroc that they came off of."
10,"November 14, 2004 5:27PM",ghulet,"let's see, sedan, six, no front bumper, in primer, for three grand. uh, no. could be a saver for the right price, but that definitely is not. dump. and someone tell him (and all the other yahoos) that all chevy wheels are not interchangable.

i'm with andre on the chevy versus the plymouth, at least that one's cheap and not been messed with yet, and who else will have one?"
11,"November 14, 2004 7:00PM",fintail,"for 3 grand, scrap that chevy for sure. that's nuts.

the plymouth is a bargain in comparison."
12,"November 15, 2004 7:49AM",1racefan,"agreed - scrap it!!!

""and someone tell him (and all the other yahoos) that all chevy wheels are not interchangable.""

i remember back in the early 90's, those yahoos used to put those same wheels on their lowered s-10 pick-ups."
13,"November 15, 2004 8:52AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well we have to have the rule about paying the asking price because otherwise no one would vote unless they had all kinds of qualifiers on price. we would get bogged down on the car's value, which isn't the question. just about anyone would save anything if the price is low enough.

the point is that by voting junk at the asking price, you are saying that the car is not worth restoring at that price. you are making a judgment basd on the car itself and its worthiness, not just its value.

and that's the exercise i'd like to practice here.

as a compromise, i'll try not (nor should you) to post ads that are ridiculously and obviously overpriced, but rather ads where there is a chance that out of passion or nostalgia or whatever, someone might pay that price.

okay, here's another one coming up!"
14,"November 15, 2004 8:58AM",Mr_Shiftright,"this car has a ""firm price"" on it so no whining andre.

http://www.craigslist.org/pen/car/48862341.html"
15,"November 15, 2004 9:27AM",1racefan,"in the southeast, i see plenty of these ss's that come with a drivetrain and ""decent"" bodies for the same or less money. from my standpoint (and i hate these cars), when i think of an ss monte, the coolest looking ones were the black ones. if i were going to restore one, i would restore one to the color that i think looks best on the car. in this case, the entire interior would have to be gutted as blue/white wouldn't look too good with a black exterior."
16,"November 15, 2004 9:28AM",andre1969,"that one looks like it might have potential, provided the body really is all that the guy is saying. i'm a little leery though, when he mentions the tranny that had been in it, the 700r4. i think it's essentially a thm350 with overdrive, but i don't know if it's a physically bigger tranny than the 350, which may have required cutting into the floorpan and modding the frame to take it.

and it also has junk wheels and tires, so to really get the whole effect, it needs an engine, tranny, and wheels. plus the paint job.

i do like the idea though, of having a decent body to start with, where you can decide what engine and tranny you want to put in. the g-body coupe is actually a pretty hot item among the rodders right now. i believe it's the smallest, lightest body-on-frame car gm has built, so that helps alot with performance. and in general, they're still popular cars anyway, as a lot of people still love the style of them.

so i guess i'd sway towards ""save"" on this one. provided of course, that it's all the seller says it is. and i will admit that i'm a bit biased with these, as i've always loved that platform, and had 3 of them over the years (1980 malibu coupe, 1982 cutlass supreme, 1986 monte carlo)"
17,"November 15, 2004 9:32AM",1racefan,"but notice that the seller says tranny/engine will cost extra. i agree that the body does look pretty good. i would maybe (if i liked these cars) consider $2500 if it came with a drivetrain, and i wasn't that particular about what color it was."
18,"November 15, 2004 9:33AM",Mr_Shiftright,"okay, we have 1 for 1 against.

i'm voting no on this one. he should have thrown in the engine and trans, it's stupid to withold those from the new owner. what i learned from this ad is that you don't ""keep"" part of the project. it's all or nothing!

so it's 1 for, 2 against.

anyone else care to comment on this ""project""?"
19,"November 15, 2004 9:51AM",andre1969,"is actually somewhat the reverse of a car i looked at a few months ago. that car was a 1980 chrysler cordoba ls. it had a drivetrain that had been hopped up pretty nicely...318 out of a '75 dart, with the lean burn swapped out, a torqueflite 727, and a rear-end with suregrip out of a '69 or '70 charger. this sucker sounded beautiful when you fired it up. unfortunately, the body was rusting pretty badly, and these things are unitized, which makes it worse. the soft plastic panels that finished off the rear of the car were shot, and the front-end, which was somewhat reminiscent of edura, was distorted. the interior also needed work. and the brakes were shot. but damn that engine sounded nice!

still, i think i'd rather have a nice, solid body that i could drop an engine into (and chevy 350's are a dime a dozen) than a nice drivetrain that's in a body that might be falling apart in a few years.

i wonder how much he'd sell the whole thing for, with the engine/tranny? only monte ss reference point i've had lately was one that's been for sale at a lot up the street from me, for awhile now. here's a pic of it: http://www.melvinmotors.com/images/vehicles/monte87_burg.jpg
i forgot what they had been wanting for it (i posted it awhile back) but they're down to $5750 now."
20,"November 15, 2004 10:09AM",stickguy,"i vote yes on the ss, although i agree that the price is a bit high, assuming that the body and interior is as nice as presented.

for a project, i would be dropping in a fresh/better/different motor anyway, and body work can get expensive. why pay for a drivetrain you don't want, if it is getting yanked anyway (assuming it would be crap to start with).

i'm not ready yet for a resto project 9and it wouldn't be one of these), but i when i am, i will definitely start with the soundest platform i can, not a cheesey rust bucket.

actually, i want overhaulin to come get my car, although the fact that i am in nj and don't have a bomber to take works against me."
21,"November 15, 2004 10:21AM",Mr_Shiftright,"okay so it's 2 to 2, andre apparently abstaining.

let's get one more vote and then go on to another perhaps from someone else."
22,"November 15, 2004 10:29AM",andre1969,"...abstinence! ;-) i thought you already had me down as a save, shifty?"
23,"November 15, 2004 10:33AM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh, sorreeeeeee...you just aren't assertive enough in these votes, andre. i need you to slam your fist on the table here like you ""mean it"":)

okay, so andre votes save and we'll call it like that.

anyone have an interesting ad, with photos and a price, or if not, i'll post another.

ps: i think that monte is a loser at that price, but oh, well."
24,"November 15, 2004 10:39AM",andre1969,"for car ads? i mainly look at ebay, but how would you determine an asking price for an auction item?"
25,"November 15, 2004 11:55AM",andys120,junk it! they were mediocre cars with mediocre powertrains and blah styling.
26,"November 15, 2004 12:14PM",1racefan,"one neat site is carsinbarns.com, but i haven't figured out how to just post a link for an individual car. most links bring up a whole page of cars."
27,"November 15, 2004 12:37PM",ghulet,"...on craigslist.com, which i just discovered, thanks to someone here (perhaps nippononly?). in any case, lots of fun, another e-timewaster for me. oh, and it has real estate, job listings, and some fairly explicit personal ads, some with photos even. 'nuff said.

i've found that craigslist is an especially good clearing house (in chicago, anyway) for 'distress sale'-type cars. y'know, broke kids with cars they've had since college, now sitting on the streets of chicago, in danger of being towed away because they blew a head gasket or dropped a tranny and the owners can't afford to get them fixed. lots of potentially decent $250 fixer-uppers. of course, with these types of cars and owners, you often don't know what is really wrong with the cars, or what's been neglected, or what's wrong in addition to what the owner discloses, so it's not unlikely you may be stuck with a $200 car that needs $2500 in repairs, only to be worth $1500 in the end.

back on topic. at $2500, it's very hard for me to get excited about a 20 year-old monte clad in primer with no drivetrain. i love the endless 'all it needs is a coat of paint' refrains from those trying to sell what are basically rolling scrapheaps. the interior is not perfect, it's got a trunk full of parts, no factory wheels, no decals and no right side mirror, from what i can tell from four photos. even if restored properly (at which point the new owner would be hopelessly buried), it would never be anything more than a frankenstein. scuh-rap it."
28,"November 15, 2004 12:41PM",lemko,"...on the monte carlo. this was the last generation of the monte carlo i really liked. i would be putting in my own upgraded powertrain as well.

though the vote was junk for the 1954 plymouth, i'd have voted save even at $1,000. the bodies were built by briggs back then and last forever. i've seen these period mopars sit in junkyards for 40 years and the bodies are still intact. though they were dull cars then, they are uncommon enough to be interesting today. my grandfather had the more ungainly 1953 plymouth.

for the 1955 chevrolet, i'd vote junk at that price. first of all, the car is a four-door sedan which isn't the most desirable body style. second, i'd have to undo all the crap he did to the car. third, the old camaro wheels are a clear sign that this vehicle belongs to some mulleted yahoo."
29,"November 15, 2004 1:47PM",andre1969,"to do something similar to that monte with my '82 cutlass supreme. it had a good, sturdy body, but the 231 died around the 73k mark. well, i also had a '69 bonneville, that had a great-running 400 (although it had a voracious appetite for starters) but the body was pretty banged up, and it was just a 4-door hardtop.

i had fantasized about trying to put that 400 in the engine bay of the supreme, but in the end common sense got the better of me, and i got rid of them both. sometimes though, i wish i'd tried it!"
30,"November 15, 2004 3:25PM",jlflemmons,"it was not a good car when new, and has little collectors value. the ss adds a little, but it looks like the numbers will be wrong on the engine/tranny. if all matched and ran, maybe 1500. but still just a $1500 beater, imho.

jim"
31,"November 15, 2004 5:07PM",fintail,"for the money, i'd junk the monte. there's a really nice and well kept one of the same year and colors not too far from me for like $4500. it's money better spent."
32,"November 15, 2004 8:44PM",Mr_Shiftright,"here's one for you to look at and judge:

http://www.craigslist.org/eby/car/49038442.html

ps: if you want to post ebay project cars, pick cars with the ""buy it now price"" and we'll assume that's the price.

for craigslist, you can find project cars by typing ""project"" into the search window.

other sources would be www.traderonline.com, and click on the ""collector car"" tab. you can assume that the asking price is the price.

trick is to pick projects that are kind of borderline, so that we will actually have to give it some consideration. cars that are 99% done or 99% trash aren't as much fun.

i'll throw this one is as a joke. don't vote on it unless you are really crazy.

http://www.craigslist.org/eby/car/48959970.html"
33,"November 16, 2004 5:32AM",1racefan,"my buddy just bought this same year/model with 93,000 miles on it for $3500. car was really sound mechanically, and the body was really good, but the paint was faded.
i have said scrap the other cars so far, but i will go out on a limb here and say keep this one. if and i say if you are willing to dig thru junk yards and spend time on the internet looking for good, inexpensive replacement parts, and if you have the mechanical ability to replace and fix most of this cars problems, you could probably get enough use out of this car to justify the amount of $ you put into it. on these older luxury cars a lot of times you can really be taken to the cleaners on something as simple as a replacement power seat motor. however, if you are not in a rush to restore it, and can take the time to search for good, inexpensive replacement parts, it might be worth it."
34,"November 16, 2004 7:19AM",andre1969,"the lexus. if it would start up and run, i'd take the chance, but that's the one thing that worries me. i could deal with the body damage, and even the torn interior. but the not-starting thing is the killer, for me at least. and i'm imagining that this thing is not like that monte, where replacement engines and trannies are a dime a dozen!

scrap the buick, too. i'd actually like to see something like that be saved, because i know they have to be really rare by now, but i'm not gonna be the one to put my money up for it!"
35,"November 16, 2004 7:23AM",fintail,"i don't know about the lexus...depends on why it doesn't run. you can get a worn but roadworthy one for the cost of a few repairs on that one plus the asking price, so it's hard to say. if it needs any significant engine work....scrap it."
36,"November 16, 2004 8:40AM",Mr_Shiftright,"seem to me that if the lexus ran it would say so. i'm very suspicious of the ad on that basis. what does it take to slap on a pair of battery cables?

i'm with andre on this one, scrap it.

in fact, even for free this car would not be worth the trouble to re-hab, based on the premise that it isn't going to run very easily, that it will need some digging into.

so based on how it sits and the price on it, i don't personally see the point of fixing it.

the buick goes without saying. if this were a very rare piece of american history, sure, but really you can buy cars like this ready and running for under $20,000. might be worth saving the motor and trans, however, if they aren't rusted into oblivion. also you can use a few body parts as models to re-make panels on a nice car that might have something missing."
37,"November 16, 2004 8:51AM",seminole_kev,"real iffy to me. if it was something simple like a starter, or if it cranked over but didn't start, maybe but if your iffy up front about it, that ain't a good sign.

i say scrap."
38,"November 16, 2004 8:54AM",andre1969,to swap a chevy 350 into one of these? ;-) is that as sacreligious as when you do it to a jag?
39,"November 16, 2004 9:06AM",lemko,"...on the lexus until i went back and read the ""won't start"" part. it could be something as simple as replacing the battery or starter or it could be something as sinister as a seized engine. the ad is too vague. i could deal with the body damage and torn interior as the car would make a pretty good beater car. i'd say ""junk"" due to the vehicle's inability to start and fierocious expense to get it back into operating condition."
40,"November 16, 2004 9:42AM",Mr_Shiftright,"besides, they are complex and expensive cars to fix.

okay, here's another one: this could be tough to figure, but give it a try.

http://www.craigslist.org/nby/car/49079594.html"
41,"November 16, 2004 11:27AM",seminole_kev,"at $7,500, i walk. '58 isn't near as popular as the 55-57's and for $7,500 i think i could do better than a project car. i think i have some sort of mental block about spending much more than 4 grand on a project or ""tinkering"" car."
42,"November 16, 2004 11:47AM",lemko,...the car has too many mods to restore it back to original condition. looks like an aborted street rod project.
43,"November 16, 2004 11:54AM",1racefan,"i love the way the seller photographed it wet to make it look ""extra shiney""."
44,"November 16, 2004 11:55AM",Mr_Shiftright,"what's a fully done, non-stock '58 chev impala street rod worth anyway?

hard to say because modded cars are valued mostly on the quality of the work.

but let's figure $12,000-$15,000 for a real nice job.

can you get from this to that with this project car for $7,500??"
45,"November 16, 2004 12:04PM",andre1969,"but i don't know at this point. i do remember, for a brief moment in the late 80's or early 90's, '58 impalas were actually commanding a higher price than '57 bel airs! or maybe that was just the convertible?

aah, what the hey. i'm gonna go out on a limb and vote save. i've always liked the '58 impala, even as a little kid. always preferred it to the '55-57 chevies."
46,"November 16, 2004 1:25PM",shiphro,"i'm not in a position right now to have a 'project' car. i will be in a few years and i'll have a tough decision to make.

but here in the northeast, old american iron is hard to come by. road salt, rain and limited space have worked together to destroy almost everything older than 15 years or so. around here a fiero is a classic collectible.

so even something as 'plebian' as a '58 (not '57? gasp) chevy could turn a lot of heads if it was cleaned up.

save it."
47,"November 16, 2004 1:26PM",gsemike,"i've always loved this car since american grafitti but it is a lesser can than 55 to 57. this seller has done some nice work already but there is still a long way to go. i'd vote walk at $7500. notice that there are no pictures of the interior or floor?

i'd put the higher and at $20k for this, but it would be cherry for that much."
48,"November 16, 2004 3:25PM",bumpy,"i think the real warning flag on that lexus is the ""theft recovery"" tag, which equals curb-jumping, cop-chased joyride and all the myriad little gremlins that come with that. i wouldn't touch it unless i had another one on hand to use as a parts car (or vice versa).

http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/ebayisapi.dll?viewitem&rd=1- &item=4502397688&category=6251&sspagename=wdvw

i think this one is worth saving, depending on the reserve ($1000 or maybe as high as $1500 if it is as rust-free as the arizona locale implies). the true wideside bed has to be pretty rare on a pre-1960 gm truck. i'm tempted to bid on this one myself, put in the muncie 318 it probably had to begin with, and drop in a gmc 305 v6 if it would fit. sadly, i don't have anywhere to keep it out of the weather long enough to finish the 3-4 other projects i have lined up already."
49,"November 16, 2004 3:45PM",andre1969,"on that '59 gmc pickup. however, i would ditch that s-10 frame that comes with it! the idea of putting a full-sized pickup from an era when before they learned how to roll paper-thin sheetmetal down on the frame of a compact truck that probably has the gvwr of a modern 4-cylinder accord just doesn't set too well with me!

as for theft recovery, i was a little leery of that, too. one of the biggest pos's i had was a 1988 chrysler lebaron turbo...a car that had been stolen several times while in my (well actually my ex-wife's) possession. i've often wondered if one reason it crapped out so badly later in its life was the joyrides?"
50,"November 16, 2004 5:41PM",ghulet,"er, well, potentially nice, but a good low-rust beginning, anyway. of course, we don't know the reserve, so this candidate really isn't quite 'fair'. anyway, i vote 'save'.

here we go again with the interchangable chevy wheels: note the early '70s chevelle/nova wheels attached to that s-10 frame! oh, when will it end?"

i appreciate the sellers forthrightness about the condition. his diatribe is actually a little amusing.

he doesn't know the milage, has that cheeso rear hatch and an 88 t/a isn't that collectible to begin with. this car in great shape and about 100,000 miles is worth 5 grand if you find a loyalist. it's also not a good sign that the seller is running a trans am junkyard out of his driveway besides.

62,"November 17, 2004 10:42AM",andre1969,"as the '57-58 chrysler and desoto, on the 126"" wheelbase, are my favorite cars of all time. but even i'd have to let that one pass at that price.

i'd have to actually see pics of the quarters, rocker panels, and floors to really make a decision though.

if it was a new yorker or desoto firedome/fireflite instead of just a windsor, then it would be a no-brainer for me, and i'd vote save in a heartbeat. but it's just a poly-head and not a hemi, like those other cars would have. and those others were more likely to have the 3-speed torqueflite, whereas this thing, along with the desoto firesweep, most likely just had a 2-speed powerflite. i could be wrong on that one, though.

and it's a shame that some of the body parts that don't look rusted out, like the hood, driver's side door, and front bumper are still damaged."
63,"November 17, 2004 10:52AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i'd vote scrap because the car is too far gone and isn't an interesting model anyway.

64,"November 17, 2004 10:55AM",andre1969,you follow up my favorite mopar of all time with my favorite caddy of all time! i'm going to tell common sense to take a flying leap and vote save on this one! i can even do with the earl sheib paintjob!
65,"November 17, 2004 11:04AM",1racefan,"61 was the year of the restyle. this one looks pretty good. i think there were @16,000 of these 2 door hardtops made that year. looks like this one is missing the fender skirts and 2 hubcaps from a cosmetic standpoint."
66,"November 17, 2004 11:09AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yep, color's wrong and the transmission is probably toast. if it was a simple leak, why not fix it? probably front pump, etc. etc.

this one is very edgey at the price because you can buy 'em pretty nice for $6,500. so facing the removal of that ghastly paint job and possible trans overhaul and all that, this is obviously a car you are just gonna buy and drive around while people make fun of it.

so i'd vote tentative save with the qualifier that you do not attempt a restoration, otherwise, part it out to restore a more worthy convertible. i assume lots of chrome goodies and interior switchgear, etc. is interchangeable...or if you need an engine or trans core to rebuild."
67,"November 17, 2004 11:10AM",andre1969,by that caddy. where is san leandro? anywheres near san andreas? ;-)

72,"November 17, 2004 11:45AM",seminole_kev,"if there's not a lot of hidden rust, interior is decent, and it runs......i'll vote save on the caddy."
73,"November 17, 2004 11:51AM",stickguy,"probably about $650-$750 ??

i don't care for the caddy myself, but it certainly looks/sounds nice enough to save, although the correct price isn't something i would have any idea about. but, for a collectible/classic/funky old car, $3,500 doesn't sound like much money at all, and you really can't get too buried in it (not like paying $12,000 for a 2k car).

if you really want it (like andre), and plan to keep it, overpaying by a few bucks ain't the worst thing in the world."
74,"November 17, 2004 12:13PM",lemko,"shoot, maybe i'll go for it! that god-awful paint job has to go! ugh, what was he thinking? transmission isn't a problem. a good friend of mine owns a transmission shop and would cut me a break."
75,"November 17, 2004 12:17PM",andre1969,"that's still pretty reasonable. last time i took the intrepid in for a tranny service, it came out to a whopping $79. and the guy actually apologized for the high price! in comparison my '79 nyer was $65, but the intrepid takes a special type of fluid that's more expensive.

i would loooove something like that '61 caddy, but i'm wondering if i should hold out for a convertible?"
76,"November 17, 2004 12:27PM",gsemike,"for $3500, that ride is sweet. end of story. i'd never be able to park it in queens, but otherwise, i love it. put it this way, for $3500, what is better: the caddy or a 98 contour?"
77,"November 17, 2004 2:11PM",stickguy,"andre: you already have a full size convert though. or would yo uget the caddy and replace some of hte other old iron?

if i get a toy, it will be a convertible, but i do recognize that the fixed roof models will generally be cheaper to buy and own,, and probably less problematic (and chaeper to restore)."
78,"November 17, 2004 2:24PM",bumpy,"i don't mind the paint job on the caddy so much. it's gaudy, but so is the rest of the car. $3500 isn't bad for a '61 that's not a beater, so i say keep it."
79,"November 17, 2004 5:22PM",ghulet,"yes, keep it. this car doesn't look like a basket case, which is usually what $3500 will buy you in an early '60s cadillac. that price is basically a bargain unless it's hiding some serious faults.
can't tell if this one is the series 62 (base, power windows and seat optional) or the coupe de ville (both standard, not much difference otherwise)."

here is an interesting one. this doesn't have a buy it now price, so let's call at $4,000.

the chevelle is a little less off the beaten path than some of these other cars discussed here. there is a big market for these cars. the ss350 is less desirable than the big blocks but is still valuable and desirable in good shape.

unfortunately, the seller is short on details here. the stripe isn't factory but this does have some signs that it's authentic such as the dash and emblem on the rear bumper (1972 only). the wheels are 72 ss also although they did come in later cars. most people doing a fake usually don't bother with the dash. do the numbers match??? probably not.

being that the interior is nice, if the engine does run strong, i'd say it's ago for $3,500 to $4,000. could be a big mistake once you see it up close, but just judging from what's here."
93,"November 18, 2004 9:41AM",seminole_kev,"price isn't too bad, but i just have absolutely no interest in that car, so i have to vote scrap out of sheer disinterest alone.

*edit - this was concering the lincoln limo."
94,"November 18, 2004 9:48AM",andre1969,"on the chevelle, although it really doesn't interest me. i think it's probably worth it, but when it comes to cars like this, i'd rather have a cutlass 4-4-2 or a buick gran sport. or a gto. or a '68-69 chevelle ss."
95,"November 18, 2004 9:49AM",1racefan,"in 72, you could get the ss package added to any v8 model. that means even the 307 that was rated at @130hp (going from memory) that year could come with the ss designation. in my opinion, this kind of made the ss designation not quite as special as it was in years past. however, you could pick this one up for 4 grand, put a paint job on it and drive it around. i would say keep it."
96,"November 18, 2004 9:50AM",seminole_kev,"ok, assuming your $4000 price, no major rust, runs like he says, and if (big if) this is an actual ""ss"".......i say save. i'd be interested in it despite the current paint(s)."
97,"November 18, 2004 10:07AM",seminole_kev,anybody now many ss models were made in '72? i've got no idea.
98,"November 18, 2004 10:54AM",1racefan,"5,333 of the ss 454's - i don't know production #s for the other engines. but like i said earlier, by 72 you could get the ss package added on any of the v8 models. i think there was a 307, 350, 396 (i think), and 454."
99,"November 18, 2004 11:38AM",lemko,"...on both the limo and the chevelle. the lincoln definately needs a new top and perhaps a paint job, but the interior looks good.

the chevelle is hardly my kind of car, but i can think of plenty of people who'd be interested in such a vehicle."
100,"November 18, 2004 12:09PM",jlawrence01,that chevelle is right down the street from me. too much money for me!
101,"November 18, 2004 12:35PM",gsemike,seriously right down the street from you??? i was just making a guesstimate on the price. tell us the true story of the car that the pictures won't tell. this should be interesting for those of us that always wonder about ebay cars!
102,"November 18, 2004 1:44PM",jlawrence01,i ahven't seen the vehicle. i was just surprised that it was in the next suburb of chicago.
103,"November 18, 2004 2:02PM",Robberbarron,i'd save the lincoln... especially in california. it'd make a funky and probably profitable ride for a limo service.
104,"November 18, 2004 2:12PM",Mr_Shiftright,"very iffy at $3,000. it's been so screwed with you'd pretty much have to take it apart to do anything with it.

all you've have is a beater unless you tear it down, and for all that work you might as well just go buy a nice one for not a whole lot more money. you can get a clean '72 non-ss malibu for $6,500 or so.

if by some startling coincidence this car was ""real"" and could be proven as such, as a matching #s 350/350, well then it all turns around and you *might* come out okay, because a real ss350 can be worth $12k-15k.

very odd he gives neither vin # nor data plate info. that should tell you something right there.

soooooo.....if not a real ss, scrap

if a real ss, save and do a front clip resto (firewall forward disassembly) and have yourself a nice ss driver."
105,"November 19, 2004 2:47AM",ghulet,"...just by the even wear of everything on the car ('patina') and the fact that it has all the correct ss goodies a piecemeal/fake job might have left out (dash with gauges, correct hood with pins, interior emblems, graphite wheels, buckets, console, steering wheel, among others) that this ss is real. of course, it wouldn't exactly shock me if it were fake; otoh, i can't imagine why anyone would go through the trouble of buying all that stuff do put on a crappy chevelle and then not finish it. we'll probably never know. anyway, since the 'ss' was just an option and not a separate series in '72, i don't think there's any way to decode it by vin alone. of course, it's easy enough to see if the other numbers match. or if you're lucky, the car still has its build sheet under the back seat. it really doesn't look too bad ('screwed with?'), it needs rust repair (or new fenders), paint and some detailing, but otherwise this looks as straight and complete as any 'restorable' car i've seen lately. i mean, it's not jacked up with big wheels and a trashed or transplanted interior like most old chevelles i used to see. as a 'driver' and if the buyer didn't go crazy over-restoring, i'd definitely save it. of course, the bidding is already up to almost $5k, so it's not exactly the bargain we thought it would be. still, i'd save it.

i'd also save the lincoln limo mostly because of the price and relative rarity, though i don't know what the hell i'd do with that thing if it were mine. i doubt i could find a garage big enough to hold it. in concurence with everyone else here, that thing would be a chore to drive almost anywhere."
106,"November 19, 2004 7:36AM",gsemike,"back in the day when chevelles were more plentiful, i've seen some people do some pretty dumb things to real sss.

i had a 1970 small block that i did some dumb kid stuff to such as a cheapo fiberglass hood with snorkel hood scoop. it was nice, but man.... if i had it to do over again.

i clearly remember somebody running around in a 71 or 72 ss with a scoop riveted onto the original cowl hood and radiused wheel wells with flares to squeeze in his crager sss. i'm not sure but it must have had an ""[non-permissible content removed], gas or grass.. no one rides for free sticker"" on it. someone else that i met proudly told me how he had the frame on his 69 ss convertible painted floresent green although i didn't get to see that monstrosity for myself. in this context, this car is pretty damn respetable (although it's not a 70)

this chevelle here is over 30 years old. it could have been faked and restored 10 or more years ago and then degraded to it's current shape. that said, i agree with the previous post. if it's a fake, it's a pretty good one with the interior emblems and appropriate exterior badges. $5k is getting pretty high though. since it doesn't say otherwise, i'd assume that the numbers don't match."
107,"November 19, 2004 9:20AM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh, i've seen all sorts of butchery, too. this may be 2 or 3 separate cars stitched together. sometimes you can pick up a code on the dataplate that might tip you off to an ss. apparently the market thinks an ss350 matching #s is worth something extra, as they price out almost double against the plain jane chevelles. but it would have to be documented, matching # and a 350hp car or we are just blowing smoke with this one. no broadcast sheet, no window sticker, no warranty plate, no cigar."
108,"November 19, 2004 9:25AM",Mr_Shiftright,"okay, let's try something a bit different. we'll look at projects without a price.

you guys be the appraiser and offer an opinion as to what this project might be worth:

here's what we'll do to make it more fun (please read)

1. study the ad, and write down your estimate on a sticky note. glue it to the computer.

2. make a post telling me you are ""ready"".

3. then, when i say go, we'll all post our prices. of course it won't be in real time but if we're lucky the posts will all appear more or less in a string and we can compare prices easily.

i'll wait until i get the ""i'm ready"" from 4-5 of you, maybe later today or tomorrow depending.

if this works and it's interesting to you, we'll do it a few more times. remember, don't post a price until you get the signal from hq.

109,"November 19, 2004 9:29AM",lemko,"...scare me about this truck. i don't like the fact that it has a later chevrolet motor and the wrong front end. the cab looks good, but the box looks rather shabby. check out the rotted area near the left rear wheel. if this person was building a street rod, why the low-performance 305 versus a more appropriate 350 small-block?"
110,"November 19, 2004 9:32AM",1racefan,"as lemko says, you wouldn't really be starting out with a whole heck of a lot. i don't think this is a project i would even want given to me for free."
111,"November 19, 2004 9:35AM",Mr_Shiftright,"okay, then bid it low. it's got to be worth something. or put ""free"".

mostly i'm trying out this idea. we can pick a more suitable car for appraisal later. so play along as best you can.

i gather the two of you are ""ready"" to post a price, so i'll wait for a few more."
112,"November 19, 2004 9:36AM",andre1969,"but my dad has a co-worker who has some old model a truck that he was working on as a hotrod/restoration project. this guy did most of it himself, and was really proud of it. but for some odd reason, the engine he chose to put in it was a chevy 305! and he rebuilt it himself, even! that just doesn't make any sense to me! i'm with lemko on this one...what's up with the 305, versus a 350!?"
113,"November 19, 2004 9:38AM",seminole_kev,"well maybe he just had a 305 laying about? only reason i can figure to use it. maybe he had plans on boring it out?

114,"November 19, 2004 9:40AM",Mr_Shiftright,"you have to remember that retro trucks are very hot right now (if you do them right).

maybe he got a cheap crate engine. chevy power is very inexpensive."
115,"November 19, 2004 9:57AM",seminole_kev,"the ""transmission just needs to be hooked up"" thing raises a big red flag with me.

in my experience, if there is a reasonable thing that can be done to turn a car that isn't drivable into one that is, and it hasn't been done, there is more to the story than the seller is letting on.

so many times i've seen a ""just needs _____ done and she'll run great!"" and there is a big reason they haven't done it."
116,"November 19, 2004 10:02AM",ghulet,"i always think it's funny when the seller makes claims to 'easy' or 'inexpensive' repairs. well, if those repairs were so easy and inexpensive, why didn't you just do it yourself before you sold it, hmmm?"
117,"November 19, 2004 10:09AM",Mr_Shiftright,"let's post our estimated values, shall we?

by ""estimated value"", what we are aiming for is what we think a reasonably sane person, under no pressure whatsoever, might pay for this ""project"" (not necessarily you and me, but ""them"" out there).

i think he could get $750 as is where is. that ""rebuilt"" engine looks kinda dusty, i dunno, but the parts should be worth that.

$750"
118,"November 19, 2004 10:12AM",seminole_kev,i'd bid $300. might budge to $450 after fully checking it out.
119,"November 19, 2004 10:14AM",andre1969,"a chevy engine? i know it's hard to tell from the pic, but it looks like there's something in front like a long filler neck for the oil. the olds rocket had that, but every chevy smallblock i've seen had the oil filler in the valve cover. something about the valve covers just seems a bit different too.

if that's an olds 307 and not a chevy 305, that's probably why the tranny's not hooked up. they won't mate up without an adaptor kit, as back then they didn't put in two sets of bolt holes to acommodate both chevy and b-o-p patterns like they do today.

i was gonna say $500. i think it might actually be restorable, and could make a cool truck. but i'd put a different engine in it, like a 350."
120,"November 19, 2004 10:18AM",ghulet,"i was going to say $500, too. i mean, how much is this thing worth properly (emphasis) restored? right off, it's probably going to need a new bed and rear fenders, the engine/trans mating issue, then paint. i'm sure the interior is no prize, either. not something i'd be interested in at any price, really."
121,"November 19, 2004 10:28AM",1racefan,"if it ended up being too much of a problem to restore, hopefully you could salvage it off and get the $500 back."
122,"November 19, 2004 10:42AM",Mr_Shiftright,okay anybody else want to jump in before we go on?
123,"November 19, 2004 12:06PM",jlflemmons,"not absolutely sure, but i think that by color and layout that is an olds 307. if it were an olds 350, it would be gold color. blue was the 307, iirc.

big clues are the shape of the valve cover, big oil filler tube in the front, and the dist. in the rear."
124,"November 19, 2004 12:10PM",andre1969,"what color the 307 was in my grandma's '85 lesabre, but i'm thinking it was black? i was thinking that the valve covers looked kinda olds-ish, though. and from what little you can see of the spark plug wires, it looks like the plugs point upward on this engine, versus downward on the chevy."

129,"November 19, 2004 5:16PM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh, the whole ad sounds like nonsense. unless that jaguar frame has railroad rails welded to it, you'd better not step on the gas. and the porsche story? well, if it was a 1/4 mile drag race, what do you expect between monstrous cubic inches and a 3.6 liter twin turbo car? how about the two of them at laguna seca? goodbye jaguar.

anyway, on the positive side, very tidy installation! commendable!

on the negative side, a car nobody wants in stock form, and one that nobody can do anything with in this form.

it's another $5,000 butchered xj. the world is full of them. hell, i'd buy it for the motor and put it into something appropriate, some big american iron. sell the jag body to someone building coral reefs, it's too screwed up to restore."
130,"November 19, 2004 6:32PM",seminole_kev,"but the xj's (even the series i's) aren't really doing much on the collector's circuit. so i rationalize it away as a car that's motor was so destroyed that it couldn't be saved. (it's the only way i can deal with someone intentionally dumping a great xk motor.)

anyway, like i said, at $10k, i'd still actually be interested in it."
131,"November 20, 2004 8:54AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i've driven these v8s conversions, they are simply awful. they ruin the silky smoothness of the xj and rip the guts out of the jaguar frame. buy a '67 chevelle and be happy-- at least then you have a car that is suitable for a big block engine. a jagolet is virtually unsaleable, it would be tough to unload on anybody for $10k--you'd have to do what the present seller is doing. find someone who buys it on a lark, without them putting some careful consideration into what's what, and then cash the check fast.

this car is a lot like some experimental films i've seen. it would have been more fun to just talk about it rather than actually do it."
132,"November 20, 2004 9:09AM",badtoy,"that's what america is all about -- choices.

personally, i love it. the lovely jag body is complemented by a truly serious v8 conversion, and it sounds (from both the description and the previous owner) that it was thoughtfully done.

the stock jag v12 is a boat anchor -- that is, heavy as a mountain without the power to go with it -- so a crate big-block (probably aluminum) may very well weigh significantly less than stock. i agree, the prodigious torque could bend stuff if the frame wasn't fortified, but any good engine/chassis builder would do that as a matter of course, or you'd never get the power to the ground.

that said, i'd give it a thorough inspection...but if the interior and exterior look like the pix, and if the engine installation is as it seems, i'd buy it in a heartbeat.

oh, by the way, shifty -- any race is dependent on the course. i once had a buddy with a chevelle ss ask me if i wanted to race him in my newly hotrodded toyota truck. i told him, ""sure -- i get to pick the road."" he gave me a crooked grin and said, ""oh, sure -- across a cornfield, right?"" right."
133,"November 20, 2004 10:14AM",bumpy,"jeez... if you want to do something interesting with the jag, put an rb26dett in it. sure, the rest of the drivetrain would disintegrate the first time you stood on it, but how many other people could claim to have a 'jagline'?"
134,"November 20, 2004 2:08PM",badtoy,"any engine conversion in a jag improves it. the stock engines and transmissions are junk -- not to mention the electrical systems.

the british are great at providing sweet-looking, elegant bodies with the internals of an 85-year-old quadraplegic. the combination of british styling with an american drivetrain results in the best of both worlds. and let us not forget -- these are only mechanical objects, not the holy grail. they are sacrosanct only to the degree that customers believe they are."
135,"November 20, 2004 2:45PM",seminole_kev,"what? the xk inline six engine is one of the greatest production motors of all time. with a production life span of what, 40 years or so? are you thinking only of the v12 models or what?

you sure have been throwing around that ""junk"" word like nobody's business as of late ;-)

* as i think about it, your favorite brand has only produced one production motor of equal to the xk motor in my opinion. i bet you can guess which one i'm thinking of."
136,"November 20, 2004 3:02PM",Mr_Shiftright,"jaguar engines of that type are actually among the best in the world, very long-lived, and built from 1948 through the late 1980s, a longevity matched by very few powerplants in history. that's what makes a conversion to a chevy v8 so dumb. they throw away the best part of the car!

of course, longevity alone is not evidence of a great engine (witness the dreary buick v-6) but winning lemans is. never saw a chevy v8 do that yet. junk motors don't win lemans. even ford bested chevy in that department.

so we must give credit where credit is due because the historical record justifies it.

calling a jaguar engine ""junk"" is a very hasty remark i think, given the illustrious history of the motor. it's simply not a fair statement given the evidence to the contrary. i wish to defend the honor of a great inline six if i may.

ah, the old ""choice"" argument. well there are good choices and bad choices. sometimes freedom to act should be restricted, and this frankenjag is one of those cases. i think the builder should be fined and a tracking collar should be placed on him to prevent him going near a toolbox for 6 months.

just kidding. but next time, builder, go tub a camaro if you want to run pro street."

this is a nice off-beat car for the era. i've always loved this car and think that this spoilerless and vinyl topped example is pretty cool.

i'm not sure what the ceiling is on these because formulas have less of a following than a trana am (maybe $10,000 to $12,000 i'm guessing).

i think that this could be an awesome car, but i'm scared of a 30 year old car from new hampshire. with a starting bid of $3,800 i'd walk but would love this for $2,000."
138,"November 22, 2004 2:18PM",ghulet,"the seller basically says it's a rust bucket, so i think $3800 is a bit dear as a starting point. after all, this is *supposed* to be an auction, right? this guy sounds like he really just wants to change it into a t/a clone (shame, really, that someone thinks a t/a clone is more desirable than a factory formula), but is being forced to list it by a boss or spouse or something. production of '70 formula=7708, compared to 3196 tas, so it's still fairly rare. it is remarkable that it's all original, down to the am radio; not too many survivors of this ilk this old. this is a low-option car, though (no a/c, no power stuff, no gauges, base interior, am radio), so i guess nothing to get too excited about. still, that $3800 doesn't give a whole lot of wiggle room to restore it."
139,"November 22, 2004 2:48PM",gsemike,"i think the fact that this car is a granny stripper makes it a little more unique while making it less imperative to keep it 100% original. i'm picturing it in deep blue with a perfect white top, some nice 17 inch aftermarket wheels, a little engine work....

again, at $3,800 it's a walk, but i do like this car and it's potential even though it is a lot of work. for $2 grand, it would be a go."
140,"November 25, 2004 11:53AM",badtoy,"my comment about jag engines. truly, the straight six in the e-type was a wonderful engine, and it provided power equal to many other cars more than twice its price at the time. almost bought one (bought another alfa instead, but i've always kind of wondered....).

the engine i was referring to was the v12. sorry, i may be off-base on this, but my personal and close-to-personal experience with this engine is that it's hard to maintain, produces little power relative to its mass, displacement and weight, and is outperformed by any number of garden variety, extremely reliable, v8s. in fact, cherry automotive parts in toledo, ohio had a v12 block in its lobby as the base for a glass-topped coffee table. i asked the owner about it, and he said that's about all it was good for. (they are, or were, the major supplier of parts for imports within a 200-mile radius, which is why i was there -- i was looking for body parts for my 240z.)

i think one of the best indications of how good an engine is in the overall sense is how often it's used as a replacement powerplant in other cars. for years, european specialty carmakers used chevy small blocks and chrysler big blocks for their cars -- such as the jensen interceptor, facel vega, monteverdi, bizzarini, iso and others. that speaks worlds to me."
141,"November 25, 2004 12:17PM",badtoy,"seminole: sorry if i seem to be using the word ""junk"" a little too often lately -- it's not intentional, nor is it due to any crankiness on my part. i just don't share the same reverence for mechanical objects many of my fellow enthusiasts do, believing as i do that they are simply mechanical objects whose financial worth may be determined by an infamously ill-informed and fickle collectors market, but whose true worth lies only in the pleasure they bring to you personally. i am also a firm believer in anyone's right to do whatever he pleases with his personal property, no matter how it may shock or offend the general population.

the entire reason i never bought a jag is because of its long-standing reputation for building cars that wouldn't start or would leave you stranded -- particularly on a rainy day, which is the least convenient time to be stranded. the only problem i ever had with my alfas was their appetite for head gaskets, and i honestly believe the responsibility for that rests squarely on my shoulders, for driving them the way i did. on the other hand, i've driven all my toyotas that way, and they never fail. derive from that whatever you will.

as for great toyota engines, in addition to the 7a-fe used in the supra tt, the 4a-ge in all of its various iterations was a truly monster motor for its displacement, and is still used today in 240-hp form as the spec engine for the toyota atlantic series. i found this engine to be every bit the equal of my alfas in terms of smoothness and willingness to rev, and by far their superior in terms of strength, durability and performance enhancements. the 22r used in the toyota truck was also a wonderfully robust engine, whose only weakness was the head gasket (a problem long since addressed)."
142,"November 25, 2004 12:21PM",badtoy,"hey -- how about sliding a 7a-fe into that jag? traditional styling with an upgrade to an inline 6 of modern design, with 1000 hp potential. hmmmm......."
143,"November 25, 2004 1:16PM",Mr_Shiftright,"most of jaguar's problems was not the engine itself but the stuff attached to it...when the engine doesn't start that's the electrical, when it overheats that the poor radiator design, etc etc.

so that's why people differ on this subject i think.

even the propensity of the v-12 to catch fire (which it likes to do) is really a matter of lousy engineering.

there aren't many endemic internal failures in jaguar engines, and like i said, chevrolet never won lemans---that's a 24 hour beating, so those jag engines (much more stock then, then lemans engines today) can't be too bad. people used to drive their cars sometimes to lemans, race them and go home--lol! imagine trying that today!

7a-fe would be too weak for that car i think. bottom ends can only take so much, you'd have to radicalize it and that's $$$.

maybe a supra engine, or a bmw i-6, both outstanding powerplants and the right # of cylinders without too much racket and vibration."
144,"November 28, 2004 5:41PM",badtoy,excuse me all to hockey sticks and back...i meant to say the 2jz-gte (the later supra motor). it has a bottom end that will hold up a house. the only problem is finding one for a decent price.
145,"November 28, 2004 5:46PM",seminole_kev,"that is the motor that i think of as a modern day xk motor. solid, sturdy motor with good power."

148,"December 2, 2004 2:53PM",gsemike,"this board has been pretty quiet lately so let's see what you think of this repairable prelude for $3,000 buy it now:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/ebayisapi.dll?viewitem&cate- gory=6259&item=4509062658&rd=1&sspagename=wdvw

it seems like the seller is overstating the book for this car with this milage. according to kbb.com, this car's private party value in ""good"" condition is $7,600. the higher value is probably from a dealer in excellent condition, but nothing with a salvage title rates an excellent.

at $3,000, it's close. i'm wary whenever you seller rattles off the list of ""easy"" fixes. if they're so easy, why aren't they done yet? nonethless, if i could do the work myself, i think that i may go for this. would probably like it alot more at $2,ooo to $2,5oo."
149,"December 2, 2004 2:58PM",michaellno,"on the surface, it seems like a good deal, but i suppose the idea is that the buyer would put the money into the repairs and drive it into the ground.

not sure that there would be any point in trying to repair then resell it, what with the salvage title.

i've got a guy at work who is doing something similar with a porsche boxster .. it's been in the shop for a couple of months now getting ""repaired"" -- i'll have to ask him how close he is to getting it back."
150,"December 2, 2004 3:03PM",gsemike,"one thing is for sure: with the axle damaged, you can bet that they laid a beating on this thing."
151,"December 2, 2004 3:54PM",Mr_Shiftright,"that car is hurt bad...real bad. this is no ""easy fix"". think about how far that wheel has travelled and what was attached to it at the time.

wrecking yard! let's give some deserving kid that engine!"
152,"December 2, 2004 4:40PM",jlawrence01,"if it was such an easy fix, the individual selling it would have made the fix and be driving it right now.

there is a certain person on this board who once said that he could take nearly any car over 5 years old and could total it for the cost bringing it up to manufacturer's standards. on this one, the airbages alone are what $3k? looks like it could be a real mess."
153,"December 2, 2004 6:36PM",Mr_Shiftright,"(valley girl accent) ""omigod...this car is...like...like....sooooooo totalled...."""
154,"December 3, 2004 1:11AM",ghulet,"it's always entertaining when someone apparently unable or unwilling to fix a car (supposedly worth $9k) tells you what an 'easy fix' it is. anyone notice the driver's door appears to be hanging open (and seems to have duct tape residue around it)? and that the lf wheel well lining is haning out? this suggests some structural damage, no? the body looks ok, so i'm thinking this thing was dragged around or went seriously airbound (with a seriously hard landing) somehow; i mean, how else would the airbags have deployed? i don't see this thing being fixed for anything near the $4k gap between the buy it now and its 'retail value' (which is inaccurate anyway, given its title status). plus, it's an automatic and has over 100k. g'bye!!"
155,"December 3, 2004 6:03AM",gsemike,"looking at that front wheel now, i've got to wonder if it's got frame damage.

from the background in the pics, it looks like this seller has some sort of business in repairables. i don't know if he buys them and flips them, or if he repairs them. in any event, it looks like the complexity of the required repairs has been understated and the potential value overstated.

to be fair, it looks like the airbags were stolen though."
156,"December 3, 2004 12:47PM",lemko,"...until you look at that left front wheel. other than the air bag, i could probably repair most of the other damage myself. too many unknowns. would pass on this one."

159,"December 4, 2004 12:44PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well if it runs really well, that's about market price, maybe a little high since the interior is so trashed. looks like about a $1,200 car all in all. the pile of what i guess were once ""parts"" in the trunk isn't re-assuring. makes you wonder how they patched this baby up.

but at $1,600 no real harm done as long as nothing big goes wrong. kind of a tired looking old thing. where's the love?"
160,"December 4, 2004 1:09PM",andre1969,i think it's definitely worth saving.
161,"December 4, 2004 1:26PM",fintail,"i think it's market price too. the car isn't too bad physically...i think the interior just needs a detailing. the mirrors are funky and incorrect and the hubcaps need to be painted. but it seems too good to scrap. the guy who bought it is just going to get it roadworthy and use it as a driver.

one thing that sets off an alarm is that it is not a 1965 model as the ad states. fintails from early 1963 on had dual circuit brakes, and by looking at the master cylinder on this car, it does not have these brakes. the serial number given also points to an earlier car, probably early in the 1963 model year production run. damn i'm a geek about these things.

i paid $1600 for my fintail 10 years ago, maybe in one grade better condition. i have a handful of parts in my trunk too."
162,"December 4, 2004 8:03PM",Mr_Shiftright,"there's a lot about the car, even from photos, which suggests that this car is a patched up pile of bolts. but as ever, we wish the dreamer that his dreams come true, whatever they may be. for me, nothing looks shabbier than a shabby mercedes. it's one car that never looks good even a bit ratty."
163,"December 5, 2004 10:17AM",fintail,"any shabby once-upscale car is the saddest thing on the road. a ruined rolls or even a once-grand old caddy can be depressing in a way.

that fintail also likely has had a drivers door replacement. mirrors were on the fender through 63, on the door for 64-65. that car has both. i hope it's at least good mechanically."
164,"December 5, 2004 11:13AM",Mr_Shiftright,a blue spray painted valve cover is not a good sign for a benz.

168,"December 6, 2004 10:01AM",seminole_kev,"or that it would have rust around the cowling. i remember my '66 needed both a new floor pan (ahem that i just pop riveted in some sheet metal.....hey i told the guy i was selling it to about it!) and it had some rust in the guttering in the cowl.

it was a neglected pennsylvania car, so it had a weeee bit of rust. worked for a first car though."
169,"December 6, 2004 10:17AM",andre1969,"had some rust in the driver's side floorpan, from leakage around the windshield and from the fresh air intake, over the decades. i pulled the carpeting out and sanded it down the best i could. then i took a paint brush and painted a thick layer of waterproof exterior house paint. then i took some silver krylon or duplicolor, or something like that, and sprayed over the house paint.

well, that was back in 1993, almost 12 years ago. the car still leaks from time to time, but i've never put my foot through the floor boards. still, i'm almost scared now, after all that time, to lift the carpet again!"
170,"December 6, 2004 11:26AM",stickguy,"reminds me of my '75 corolla (bought well used). it had some damage right behind the drivers side front wheel, which led to a hole in the floor(sorta to the left of the clutch pedal, where it starts to curve up). anyway, being a poor student, i lookded around the garage, and found a spare roof shingle.

anyway, some body filler to hold it in place, and that shingle made a perfect floor board patch (just peeled the mat back, installed, and covered it over).

bringing this back on topic, even the pros (or at least the tv shows like dream car garage) seem to get surprised by what they find when they strip a car down. so any of these project cars, even with a basic pre-purchase inspection, are likely to divulge deep dark secrets as the work progresses.

to me, i am either buying a car to use as is (either a beater or one that was fully restored), or plan a full resto. at least that way you have some expectations.

the worst thing you can do is get a car that you know has some needs, but you only want to do simple/cheap stuff to it (just the ""basics""). i think this is where all those failed projects you see on ebay come from.

actually, the best bet might be to get on overhaulin. at least it is quick and you don't have to pay for it."
171,"December 6, 2004 11:01PM",Mr_Shiftright,"okay, help me put a value on this car:

1969 chevy chevelle malibu 2 door hardtop.

""matching numbers"" 350 v8 w/ original 4 speed manual transmission. color maroon.

body looks good from 20 feet. has plenty bondo says the magnet. some rust bubbles at rocker panels, some rust bubbling at windshield trim and rear windscreen trim. chrome bumpers have rust spots. interior okay, but hole in carpet near gas pedal, door panels faded, seats (buckets) faded, headlliner sagging. runs well, you can drive it home. one owner 30 years, engine rebuilt ten years ago.

price range?"
172,"December 7, 2004 5:08AM",seminole_kev,"i stink at pricing the ""classic name"" cars from the sixties (always worth more in a sorry shape than i'd pay) so i don't know. to me, maybe $1000-$1500 if it runs alright (which means it is probably worth more) but i will say this:

cost of chrome has gone through the roof. probably spend a good chunk of the difference between this car and a quality one on chrome bits alone. someone needs to come up with a cheaper/more environmentally friendly way to chrome stuff!"
173,"December 7, 2004 5:49AM",andre1969,"i might go a bit higher, maybe $1500-2000. i'm guessing that factory 4-speed has to be worth something. and with a 350, it would still be a decent performer by today's standards. not a musclecar, but a far cry from an inline 6 or a 307.

plus, if it's a chevy from that era, that name just pulls a lot more respect and lust than an equivalent tempest/lemans, special, or cutlass, or ford or mopar.

for some reason, the '68-72 gm intermediates were notorious for rear-window rustout, although after 30+ years, i guess you can't really fault any unrestored car for having it by now!"
174,"December 7, 2004 6:44AM",gsemike,"but a factory 350, 4 speed car does have a certain cache to it. is it basically a stock car? are you thinking of it as a driver, or for restoration? if you're thinking resto, you're probably looking at a full body strip and interior gutting. if it's truly presentable as a driver where the body may look decent for a few more years without work, it might be worth as much as $3,000. just really think about the work to be done because all parts for these have gotten so expensive and remember, it's not an ss. additionally, it seems like 70-72s garner higher prices than 68-69. there is probably a halo effect from the 454 car."
175,"December 7, 2004 7:04AM",stickguy,"i think you could probably get 4k for it if it looks respectable. sounds like a good candidate for a cloning? probably depends on the condition of the body, but if the rust is minor enough to be fixable, sounds like a minor diy restore could give yo a nice cruiser. this assumes the drvietrain (having been rebuilt) is strong.

of course, to me, the 4 speed is the key. i wouldn't give you 1k for it with an at."
176,"December 7, 2004 9:19AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah, $4,000-$5,000 is what i think market is, given that it's a ""real"" 350 with its original 4-speed. there's a big difference in the market between a 350 and a 307. of course, i'm also factoring in california, where the market is red hot for muscle right now.

i could also see a somewhat lower price, but i think personally you could get more $1,500 if it was in pieces in a dumpster."

this one here has 156k and it many not have been remarkable before it got vandalized. we're looking at repairing the damage from the vandalism and doing mechanical repairs.

194,"December 20, 2004 6:24AM",andre1969,"maybe $1000, at best, for that '71 cutlass, if i needed a car. i had forgotten that you could still get a 6-cyl in them by that time. considering how cheap and free-flowing the fuel was back then though, i'd imagine the vast majority of cutlasses had the olds 350. i don't think it was until the '73-77 redesign that small, undersized engines became really common. and they'd probably be even worse in one of those cars.

 

the body on this '71 looks pretty good, except that it appears to have been smacked a few times in the front. and any car that has a peak/beak theme upfront like that is prone to plenty of damage, because as the beak/peak gets pushed in, often it'll still look more or less okay, but put stress on other parts of the car.

 

and i don't know what that is on the floor of the car, but it doesn't look like carpet to me. looks like some kind of padded mat-type material.

 

another killer for me is the color of the car. i can't stand that gold color, although i think this is one case where a vinyl roof helps. it tones down the gold, and provides a more subdued accent.

 

it'd definitely be a fun car to build up, but as is, unless you had a car like this as a kid, and are sorely nostalgic for it, i'd pass on it."
195,"December 20, 2004 6:45AM",gsemike,"i think that this one looks alot more messed with even though it's got the 350. p/w isn't that extremely rare and i find the fastback models more appealing. being that the 70 may have been in the hands of a butcher, i prefer the 71. does the guy with the 70 even mention the mileage? it's had to have been around to get the back seat so worn."
196,"December 20, 2004 7:08AM",andre1969,"i don't think i've ever had a car with a back seat that looked that bad! now to be fair, my 338,000 mile 1968 dart doesn't have its original back seat anymore, but when i bought the car, at 253,000 miles, the back seat was fine, but just a little faded and discolored with age. the front was pretty torn up, though. and the seats were white vinyl, which, let's face it, looks dirty 15 minutes after it rolls off the showroom floor! anyway, i put in some black bucket seats out of a '69 dart gt that i had totaled, and i swapped the back seat too, so it would all match. the white front bench out of the '68 ultimately found itself in a dumpster, while the back seat went into the '69, and went with it when i finally called the junkyard to come get it.

 

then, in early '97, someone sold me a front and back seat out of an early 70's a-body for $25. looked fine, except for one small rip on the driver's side backrest. by this time, the driver's side bucket was getting really ratty looking, although the back seat was still good. i think some of the stitching at the top might have been thinning though.

 

the back seat of my '79 newport, which had about 250,000 miles on it when i got rid of it, was just about perfect. so was the back seat of my 192k '86 monte carlo, and my grandma's 157k '85 lesabre.

 

i wonder if the back seat of that '70 cutlass might have been pulled out of the car from time to time? or maybe the owner used it to store car parts and such? sometimes when a car sits around too long, things like that happen to it!"

the seller has a good feedback record, but the vin is 111026, so this is a coupe with a sawed off roof. or, perhaps the seller copied the vin incorrectly. in any case, it's not worth restoring if it truly is a coupe chop job."
198,"December 20, 2004 8:46PM",stickguy,"i can't imagine how much money you would have to sink into that benz to make it functional. can a nice driver really be worth that much?

199,"December 20, 2004 11:26PM",Mr_Shiftright,"potentially these cars are worth $50,000 if sharp, $65k pristine show, and so there is room to fix it, definitely. even a nice driver is worth $40k.

 

these are very valuable, very desirable cars and will pull strong money even crushed like a beer can."
200,"December 21, 2004 6:44AM",fintail,"i've seen concours 3.5 cabrios with asking prices pushing 6 figures. of course, it would take 50 grand to get that one into show shape. i just wonder if it is real...chop jobs are common on earlier 11 coupes, i can't see it stopping someone from ruining a genuine 3.5 low grille coupe."
201,"December 21, 2004 7:47AM",stickguy,"oh. i had no idea they could be worth that much!

 

which then begs the question, if you woned a car tha was potentially worth that much, why would yo ulet it sit for years in that condition to deteriorate?"
202,"December 21, 2004 8:05AM",andre1969,"sometimes, when you see a potentially valuable car like that wasted away to nothing, but then find a mint condition pinto or chevette that's been lovingly maintained all its life.

 

only thing i can think of is that the previous owners just had no clue that it would ever be worth that? for instance, i would never have guessed in a million years that '71 benz 'vert would be worth much. to me it's just an old car, a 70's car with a 50's windshield, a plastic rear window, and the type of door handles that the feds outlawed years ago on domestic cars.

 

now i'll say this: i think it's a neat old car, but when i look at it, i just don't see the potential for a $100k car! but then again, aren't people paying like one million for '71 hemi cudas? i never would've seen that coming, either! ;-)"
203,"December 21, 2004 10:48AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well i'm less amazed that the '71 benz cab would be worth so much, since the '71 cuda is really not much more than a mass-produced plymouth 2-door with the build quality of a taxicab, but with a legendary engine and a mythology that's priceless. the benz on the other hand, is a very high quality automobile made in limited numbers, with a precision v-8 and a million dollar ride and luxury.

 

so beauty vs. the beast and both of about equal value.

 

why is that?

 

because both are a) limited in supply and b) high in demand, even though they are like night and day in looks, quality and power.

 

fact is, people decide ultimately what is valuable. while ""quality"" is objective, ""value"" is totally subjective. we'd like to think the two always match up, but they don't.

 

this is why, for instance, a mint barbie doll from the 1950s is worth ten times the price of a genuine silver coin minted by alexander the great.

 

go figure."
204,"December 21, 2004 10:57AM",andre1969,"how much would something like that '71 benz have gone for when it was new? and what kind of performance, like 0-60, for example, would that little 3.5 v-8 have?

 

i dunno about the ""million dollar"" ride, though. from what i've heard, smaller benzes rode like trucks back then. and isn't that just a little benz? i'll admit straight up, i don't know jack about benzes. to me it looks like a 'vert version of fintail's fintail, with the fins shaved down. sure, they're nice little cars, but the only benzes i really thought of as luxury cars were the really big ones and the little 2-seaters."
205,"December 21, 2004 11:15AM",Mr_Shiftright,"having just driven one a few months ago, i would say they drive beautifully. that's the one major reason people pay big bucks for them. they are totally modern in feel and acceleration. it's an old benz you can really enjoy on modern highway with no anxiety. feels just like a year 2000 car. the 6 cylinder version strains too much and is too noisy but the v-8 is smooth and quiet, and the padded convertible top seals out wind noise.

 

as for acceleration, i don't have the figures close at hand, but i distinctly remember we used to race them against the 280sl roadsters and beat them unmercifully, so i'm guessing that about 0-60 in 8.5 seconds is very close to accurate. horsepower was about 200 din, and the msrp in 1971 was a rather shocking $15,000, when you could buy the 280sl roadster for around $10k-11k.

 

basically the cabriolet is a ""hand-built"" car with tons of leather and wood. it's a nice ride.

 

 i'd imagine, that as with the hemi cuda, if you found one at the bottom of a lake, you'd dredge for it, raise it up and restore it.

 

both of these cars are going to be saved regardless of condition."

james"
207,"December 21, 2004 3:50PM",ghulet,"i don't think this car needs a 'restoration', it's really in very nice condition for a twelve year-old car. it's got a few issues not uncommon to a car this age, but they're mainly wear and tear. i'd probably put the factory wheels back on (i live in the city and thus not a big fan of oversized wheels and low-profile tires, they damage easily), remove the window tinting and fix the nickel and dime stuff. it's hard to estimate what his reserve is, it's in nice shape, but still it's 12 years old and has 125k miles. i'm guessing $6-7k? maybe $8k? i just checked autotrader.com, there are 15 or so in the nation on that site, ranging in price from $5600-almost $20k!!

 

at this point, though the manual transmission is rare/unusual, this is pretty much 'just a used car', not really a collectible yet. in the future, perhaps, but i can't see anyone getting too crazy on the bidding just because it has a 5-speed. it's otherwise just an older lexus coupe."
208,"December 21, 2004 4:25PM",michaellno,"while i agree with you on most of your comments, i wonder why you didn't touch on the fact that the car has a ""salvage"" title. yes, the seller mentions that it received this title due to a fire (?) in the trunk, which required the replacement of some rear bodywork and bumper, but still, wouldn't you be concerned?

 

other than that, the car does look to be in good shape -- i, too, would get rid of the dorky looking sc wheels (i don't even like them on the sc430)."
209,"December 21, 2004 4:52PM",jlawrence01,that salvage title makes the whole deal smell. i would certainly want to have a couple of people who know what they are doing look at it before committing any money to it.
210,"December 21, 2004 7:35PM",gsemike,"i'd go $8k to have this as a nice driver. the ugly wheels would have to go and the explanation about the salvage title doens't hold water. if it wasn't on the other side of the country, i'd check this out."
211,"December 21, 2004 7:38PM",fintail,"old 50s mb that were really warmed over prewar cars might have driven like trucks, but by the 60s they were much improved. for example, fintails were rally and sedan series champions throughout the decade. sometimes i think my fintail handles much better than my 126...albeit noisier, but it is more willing to be tossed around. it's a surprisingly modern feel.

 

i see that lexus suffers from typical leather decay of that time period. that would annoy me.

 

the salvage title will kill sellability no matter how meaningless the damage is. beware, indeed. buy it to drive and never sell."
212,"December 21, 2004 8:20PM",jlawrence01,">>the salvage title will kill sellability no matter how meaningless the damage is. beware, indeed. buy it to drive and never sell. << my brother and i were walking our favorite lot on thanksgiving evening at midnight. i saw this sweet lexus sedan, a 2003 model. my brother asks me what's wrong with it. i thought it looked pretty good and being that the dealer is the type that sells the really clean stuff, i felt like it was a good deal. not so. $12-15k in damages, nicely repaired. ucm bought it at the auction and neglected to run the carfax. sold it to a long time customer who later demanded (and was allowed) to return it. might be a good driver but ... if it is not, i am pretty much stuck with it as someone will see the repairs when the car is up on the rack. too much risk involved for my tastes. ditto on the salvage title. could have been underwater - both literally and figuratively."
213,"December 21, 2004 9:34PM",Mr_Shiftright,"just a used car, now and forever, but i'd buy one if it were cheap enough. wouldn't restore one, though. fairly attractive as japanese cars go."
214,"December 22, 2004 5:40PM",ghulet,"...that the lexus had a salvage title, my bad. it's a nice looking enough car, and old enough that the salvage title isn't a *huge* deal as far as future resale goes, but at the same time, i'd hack at least a thousand off whatever price i'd originally imagined. still, the fact that it has a manual transmission doesn't automatically change this from a regular old used car to 'collectible'. if someone were interested in this car as a future collectible, it's doubtful they'd buy an example with 125k, slightly worn interior, modifications (minor though they may be) and a salvage title anyway, right?"
215,"December 22, 2004 7:00PM",Mr_Shiftright,"it's going to be as collectible in 20 years as every 80s japanese car is now, which is not at all. of course, you can ""collect"" as many as you want in your backyard, but that's not what i think the term really implies.

217,"December 22, 2004 10:01PM",hpmctorque,"why, in your opinion, are we not seeing at least certain japanese cars become collectible? this particular lexus has many of the attributes that make european cars collectible, such as a relatively high msrp and low production numbers, rwd, attractive styling, sound engineering, a reasonably powerful straight six, a coupe configuration, and a luxury name. okay, it's short on pedigree and soul. these are important elements for collectibility, although the lack of pedigree may be largely attributable to elitism, don't you think?"
218,"December 23, 2004 6:55AM",gsemike,"just like all lexuses... it's a nice car but it's sterile and won't invoke passion. that's why it's not collectible. maybe the v8 version, but not this."
219,"December 23, 2004 7:20AM",fintail,"i don't see it as elitism at all. some cars just don't excite the market.

 

i can look at several similar mercedes and see the same thing. i can take a slc from the 70s...2 door hardtop version of the sl, always with a v8 in na, well equipped, top engineering, high original cost, low production, unbeatable pedigree, etc....and you can't give one away. you can probably get a concours example for under 10 grand. and when you look at something like a 280ce from the same era, a smaller car with a 6, but every other factor, the price is half a slc. the market just doesn't care for either car, no matter how many good attributes it has.

 

you can even go older and look at a 111 coupe, say a 220se from 40 years ago. very competent 6, classic hardtop styling, wonderful interior, low production, high msrp, great name...and 40 years old....and a really excellent one probably would be very lucky to hit 20k.

 

and not to mention cars that are now worth so little, like jag xj6c and xjs, bmw 6 series, etc. the market just doesn't care."
220,"December 23, 2004 7:22AM",seminole_kev,"if it was elitism driving the market, why would there every be valuable fords, chevys and dodges? no, it isn't elitism that drives the market in my opinion."
221,"December 23, 2004 7:37AM",andre1969,"becoming collectible? like, say, the original datsun 240z, 260z, 280zx, and maybe even some of the 300zxes? maybe not high-dollar prizes like a hemi cuda or a '57 chevy bel air vert with factory fuel injection, but still considerably more than a 1982 accord?

 

or what about those early 70's datsun 510s? the little boxy ones that look kinda like a poor man's bmw?"
222,"December 23, 2004 9:54AM",Mr_Shiftright,"there are some japanese cars that people seek out, that it true, but they don't follow the general trend of real ""collectibles"", because:

 

a.) they are usually sought out to be modified and or raced (datsun 510, supra). this is a big no-no in terms of keeping value for collectors.

 

b) or they are very stagnant in their ""collectibility"", in terms of pricing and overall interest. a datsun 240z in perfect condition can indeed bring a decent price, (perhaps $12,000) but really that's not a very complimentary pricetag for a 33 year old ""collectible"". you could get more for a beat-up malibu.

 

i'd hazard a guess that japanese cars mostly (with a few exceptions) lack character and soul. you jump out of one into another and they look the same and feel the same. and way back when, in the 70s and 80s, they were pretty tinny cars with questionable styling and very good drivetrains.

 

but people don't collect ""reliability"" and they don't collect ""gas mileage"". they collect ""mythology"", ""race history"", ""styling"" ""prestige"", ""power"", etc., of which older japanese cars have zilch.

 

of course, this may change....everything changes. when the japanese start putting out 600 hp vipers and limited edition gt40s, maybe then.

 

but even now, the first thing most people want to do with a ""hot"" japanese new car is change it and individualize it."

226,"December 23, 2004 12:19PM",lemko,"...that lexus sc300 would make a nice daily beater car if you're not to picky. the leather is a bit more worn than i like and you can tell the wood trim's finish is cracking. i don't really have a problem with the wheels. aren't they the ones that are used on the current sc330? lexus did have a problem with those early electro-illuminescent (sp?) instrument panels. a new replacement is about $1,200, but i heard of a source for decent rebuilt units costing $600.

 

as for a salvage title, i wouldn't worry too much about resale value. the person who purchases this vehicle will most likely be its last owner and will run it into the ground. the sc300 is a far more attractive car than its lumpy audi tt wannabe replacement, but i can't see this car as a future collectible."

the bidding is at $4,6oo so let's call it 5 grand. i've got no idea what this could be worth but am aware that buicks of the era don't really have a cache to them. there are aspects to this car that look good considering the age, but it's a total resto, just like the seller says. maybe most of the panels could be saved.

this is an amusing one. the description could be picked apart endlessly. at least it didn't bring a lot.

 

hard to say what this car actually is without a vin (pic shows 6.3, descrpition says 6cyl). it's european and has been federalized with a us speedometer. evidently it is indeed a 109 (air suspended) car. very few 6.3s were made in 1968 so the believeability of these claims are a bit doubtful...it could have an m189 engine in it (evolution of gullwing engine). the seller getting types of airbags confused is pretty funny.

 

it appears to have a mb-tex interior and yet has bundt wheels on it, which weren't available until late 1970 as options. it also has late us model rear taillight lenses (the amber lamps were stock on all euro cars but only on us cars from the 1970 model year onward) and a becker mexico cassette unit in the dash which was only available from late 1970 onward. the taillights makes me think think that it was a euro car that was imported. the trim on the driver's door pocket does indicate that the car is a real 109 rather than just a standard 108 sel. most us spec 109s had leather upholstery though, so either the tex is european or it replaced the original us upholstery."
235,"December 28, 2004 9:10AM",gsemike,"i never realized that there were so many old beater benzes running around or that there was such an active collector market for them. before the 80's, they always seemed like solid long lasting bare bones cars to me. i guess that alot of people see charm in these cars. i have no idea what any of them are worth. give me a good chevelle and i'll analyze it down to the lugnuts."
236,"December 28, 2004 9:21AM",Mr_Shiftright,"generally they aren't worth much unless they are coupes or convertibles. any old benz beater is a money pit.

 

the reason you see a lot of them is that many people are not aware that benz is a monster producer of cars and trucks. they are not a little boutique company like saab.

 

mostly the market seems to be folks who hope to look rich for cheap, and then the true lovers of the cars like fintail (and myself to some extent). but the latter group is smart and doesn't pay big money for old 4-dooors with lots of needs.

 "
237,"December 28, 2004 9:26AM",fintail,"yeah, you can get good ones for not much, and beaters are worth pocket change. good for parts cars though, some mb people accumulate many of them at a couple hundred a pop. mb specialist i know had like 5 fintails and 10 108/109s sitting outside his place...but i think he's cleaning that up now.

 

they are also pretty durable - aside from rust - so they survive. there is a charm to them...especially in older ones...they can be pretty fun to drive if you get a better engine example, they are reliable, and non-car people tend to think they are worth a fortune, which is always amusing. a solid one is a bargain for a driver classic."

when did mercedes stop sending medium-duty trucks to the us?"
239,"December 28, 2004 9:29AM",Mr_Shiftright,"also depends on what models. you don't ever ever want a 6.3, 6.9, and most of the 68-77 models are kind of a pain to keep running right. the 190sl is a dog, too, although a very attractive little dog that is true.

244,"December 29, 2004 6:13AM",andre1969,"on that one, because i'm waiting for the bank to open up so i can withdraw $2000! depending on how much front-end work it really needs, i'd consider this one. if it's just ball joints and all the rubber junk, well hey, that's just maintenance and something any car that gets driven on a regular basis is going to need, eventually! if it's getting into more major components though, i'd have some reservations. and i'd also want to see just how bad the rust really is...

 

i'm not that concerned about the other stuff. as long as the power windows are still working, i wouldn't be that worried about the a/c. the one downside to the '71-76 mark, though, is that not all of them had rear quarter windows that opened. by the end of the run, i believe it was an option, and even on the earlier ones, they didn't roll down, but retracted about half-way, into the c-pillar. but they were such tiny little things by that time that even if they did roll down all the way, it's doubtful they would've helped much!

 

as far as the reverse light switch? heck, i've driven a '68 dart for about 85,000 miles with faulty backup lights, so no big deal! power mirror? as long as you can still push the mirror into place, i'm not concerned. emergency brake? just bring along a brick or wooden block and keep it in the trunk! ;-)

 

i guess one reservation i'd have with this car is the color scheme. to me, white with a brown interior just does not sound attractive. in fact, it seems clashy. now if it had an all-red, all-blue, or all-green interior, or an interior with white leather and red, blue, or green everything else, as was common back then, i might be tempted. but white with brown just sounds boring to me.

 

plus, normally i don't like white cars. i've had a white 68 dart for the majority of my driving life, and my stepdad always bought white cars, so it's not exactly at the top of my list! i think it does look classy on a luxury car, though. now that brown interior, imo, would sound nice if the car were painted a tasteful creme, yellow, champagne, or light brown color, or various other subtle earth-tones like what pontiac really got into in the early 80's."

246,"December 29, 2004 1:47PM",fintail,"if it is mechanically good, everything works, there is really no rust or damage, and the interior is otherwise ok...and the price is about 50% less...just maybe"
247,"December 29, 2004 5:28PM",andre1969,"in the ""new versus used"" thread, but maybe it would apply better here. i saw a car today that really tugged at my heart, crying out for rescuing. for years now, i've seen this mark v parked at the curb in front of somebody's house in my granddad's neighborhood. well, yesterday, driving by, i noticed that it had been hit, hard, in the rear. bad enough to buckle the rear quarter panel from over top of the rear wheel, on to the back of the car. the trunk was also smashed, and the bumper. i happened to go by the same way today, and it was still there, so it hasn't been towed off yet.

  

now i don't know anything about the overall condition of the car, except that usually i'd see it there, but sometimes i wouldn't, so it could at least move under its own power. it didn't look rusty, although its midnight blue paint, while still showing a reflection, did look faded.

  

for awhile now, i had entertained the idea of stopping by sometime, and seeing if they wanted to sell it, but now i guess it's too late! at this point, would something like this be worth saving, or would the body damage pretty much render it a parts car?"
248,"December 29, 2004 6:23PM",Mr_Shiftright,"the smelter, definitely. think of it this way andre--the molecules from its melted metal will one day find their way into a car you could actually drive."
249,"December 30, 2004 4:25AM",andre1969,"it's just that sometimes i'll see something that, logically, i know deserves to be junked, but my heart ends up going out to it and i get this urge to try to save it from the crusher.

has roof rack, running boards, fender flares, new pioneer am/fm tape deck, and heavy duty trailer hitch.

253,"December 30, 2004 1:41PM",seminole_kev,"at $500 i could see buying it. run it for however many miles until the motor becomes unusable and get another from a junk yard. or, if you have the time and the tools. yank the motor and rebuild it. doesn't have to be a top notch rebuild, just enough of one to refresh the motor.

 

for $500, i say it is ok to buy. now i don't care for these one bit, but for $500, pretty low risk. worse case, part it out and you could make up the difference."

256,"December 30, 2004 2:06PM",fintail,"i think that's what ours had. it developed a massive exhaust manifold leak when it had like 20k on it. i still remember the noise it made. it was also painfully slow, my dad would go on about how he wanted his plymouth horizon back! it also got rusty within 5 years (in a non snowbelt area), and it was brown on tan. i have some prejudice against it still."
257,"December 30, 2004 5:51PM",Mr_Shiftright,"it sort of depends what ""low oil pressure"" means. if it means that the engine is already knocking, then basically you have bought a $500 planter box. if it's just the needle that says pressure is low, or the red oil light is on but the motor is quiet, you could check it out further prior to purchase---either with a mechanical oil pressure gauge or just swapping in a new oil pressure sending unit.

 

but if the engine was bad i wouldn't buy it. it's a lot of work and there's no real upside--these trucks aren't worth very much clean and running anyway."

unfortunately, he also bought a '73 or '74 benz 450sl from them, at the same time. the benz arrived first, as i recall. it actually didn't act up on him too much, but i remember looking at it once, and seeing that the 6-digit odometer read something like 182,xxx.

i think it's hard to find a project car in general to really give a thumbs up on, though, because in most cases, it's going to be cheaper to just go find one that's in pristine/restored condition in the first place, than to take a project and restore it to that condition."

it's not exactly a project car but it could be modified in about a hundred interesting ways if you were so inclined. replica muscle cars are becoming increasingly popular as the prices of real ones soar into six-figure land.

if you don't have the money to buy one that's done, you're not likely to have the money to do a project right either. that's why you see so many half baked half done cars here. it's like, ""i appreciate that you've invested $10,ooo into a primered rolling shell of a 97 civic, but it's going to take another $10 grand to finish it, so it's worth $2,5oo now.""

it certainly looks like a low price for a low-mileage 928 in nice condition, whaddya think?"
282,"January 5, 2005 10:42AM",Mr_Shiftright,"seems a tad pricey. it's an s4 which is both good and bad. good in that they go real fast, bad in that the s$ engine is an interference-fit (while mine is not). automatic is good for a 928, as the clutch is a bear, but i have a 5-speed anyway because it's way more fun. (they use a dual-disk clutch system and it doesn't release very easily).

 

928 prices are historically very low but i think this is going to change quickly, now that people realize you can buy a porsche in great condition, with a v-8, that goes 150 mph, has a huge hatchback, every luxury option, and costs around $6,000 at most (for early 80s models).

 

people are 'ascared of the maintenance costs, but really you try to fix any old german car these days, be it vw, audi, benz or whatever, and you are going to get hosed, so you might as well have fun at it.

 

figure $150 a month for everything (excluding gas and insurance) to keep one on the road--presuming you bought a good one in the first place.

 

i priced a new little mitsubishi outlander the other day (just for fun) and it's $399 a month, so there you go. i'm still ahead of the game in a 928."
283,"January 5, 2005 11:07AM",andys120,"with the linkage to the rear-mounted transaxle?

 

of course all porsches have a rear-mounted transaxle but most don't have v8 torque to transmit."
284,"January 5, 2005 11:19AM",Mr_Shiftright,"it's clunky on the early cars but gets better with the newly designed clutch around 1987 i think.

 

the drivetrainset up on the 928 as well as the suspension is very very similar to the new corvette and it does make you wonder if gm bought some 928s and tore them apart.

 

torque tube bushings/bearing can take a beating on a 928, that is true. with the twin-clutch disk, when you romp on it, it doesn't much slip (racing cars often use this system), so there's a lot of stress.

 

i rather like the tamer early 928s for this reason but i can get a blower for it for only $4,900, which would punch out probably 350 hp. given the great brakes and suspension and good motor, the only real concern would be that torque tube stress and somewhat weak 2nd gear synchros.

 

best way to drive a stickshift 928---a manly grip on the gearshift and put 'er in easy."
285,"January 5, 2005 11:23AM",gsemike,"help me out. what's interference-fit mean?

 

every since risky business, i've wanted one of these. even though joel had a tough time giving joey pants the slip in his 76 caddy, that car looked good. ""there is no substitute""."

2)valves hit pistons

 

3)engine goes boom

 

4)owner goes oh $#@+**!"
287,"January 5, 2005 11:34PM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah, basically 32 very bent, very expensive sodium filled german valves gouging out the tops of 8 very expensive german pistons bringing 4 very expensive german camshafts to a grinding halt.

 

i hate when that happens.

 

the serpentine belt on the 928 engine is something like 7 feet long (maybe 5, some ridiculous length) and is difficult to adjust. they even have a slack timing belt warning light on the dash.

 

fortunately, the early 4.5 liter v8s like mine cannot bash the valves if the belt breaks, nor do i have twin cams or 4-valve heads, so that's good. but then i don't have the power of the later 928s either, which are seriously fast cars even today. to give you an idea, they accelerate rapidly with a stock 2.73 axle ratio."
288,"January 6, 2005 7:00AM",gsemike,"ok... i got it. i had a similar experience when the belt went on my 89 accord. fortunately, i was idling in trafic when it went, but the shop that pulled it off the road for me still tried to stick me for a new head. this was diagnosed without the benefit of even removing the valve cover. he offered some explanation about doing a complression check to know that the head was bad.

 

since their explanation didn't hold water, i told them not to touch it and had my regular shop pick it up. i was back on the road with a new belt and that's it.

 

this is why i hate timing belts. when i bought my last car, getting one with a chain was high on my list. found that in my 03 altima even though most new car salesmen look at you like you have two heads when you ask about that.

it looks like rust got the better of this car. i don't know if i'd take the chance but if it could be fixed properly it'd be a top-notch and potentially valuable collectible. anybody think it'd be worth saving?"
293,"January 7, 2005 7:52AM",andre1969,"how much hp would a 327 have by that time? i think earlier in the 60's, they had a 250 hp 327 and a 300 hp 327, but by '69 i don't konw. i knew a guy back in high school who had a '69 camaro ss/rs pacecar convertible, and it had a 350. when i was a kid, my mom had a '68 impala 4-door hardtop with a 327.

 

i'd imagine this camaro might be worth a bit because of being an ss, but i'd think the 327 and especially the powerglide would hurt it. that, and just being a hardtop, versus a convertible.

 

cool car, and i know i'm out of touch here with prices, but i wouldn't pay more than maybe $2-3k for it in its current condition. and the part about needing new frame rails bothers me. now i know a camaro is unitized, but i'm not sure how gm's unit bodies were designed back then. on mopars, they actually have a complete sub-frame bback there. the body will usually rust before it does, but once it starts, well that's basically like having the frame rust out on a b-o-f car. and i do know that the '67-69 camaros, firebirds, and i believe the '68-74 novas (maybe the later camaros and '75-79 x-cars, too?) were designed in a way that the front part of the car is actually isolated from the rest at the firewall. if it gets rusty enough, they can actually break apart at that point!

 

now the car would have to be a complete rustbucket at that point probably should have been retired years before, but depending on how bad the car gets underneath, it is something to consider. especially since cars can be cleaned up and have a coat of paint slapped on to look nice at a quick glance, but being ready to fall apart from the inside out!"
294,"January 7, 2005 8:43AM",stickguy,"i hate to see a good camaro go to pot, but i agree that this one is overpriced. also a bad car to buy at night under the lights, after a quick spray shine!

 

might be harder to fix the amature work than rust.

 

i think you basically have something that you either buy cheap and use up, or bite the bullet and take it apart and do it right. at least the body seems somewhat straight, but the color is iffy.

 

also, is it really an ss? the dash looked kinda strippo for that. if it's legit, must be the cheapo ss package (badges and the minor stuff). the powerglide is also a loser.

 

if the frame was solid (or easily fisable), swap in a crate 350 and 4 speed, upgrade the interior, and you might have something nice."

cheap looking interiors were par for the course in the early f-cars. it'd be easy enough to check the vin code and find out if it's a real ss.

 

i dunno the hp rating of a '69 327 but those are real nice motors. it was the first mass-produced motor to have one hp per cid in it's fuel-injected 1862 version.

 

the pg would certainly detract from the value but the dirty little secret of the muscle/pony car era is that the majority had ats especially by '69."

maybe if you had a good parts car, you could turn two into one but for $11,900 no way. if it's not a factory ss, the ceiling on the value is not that high. we don't even know if the bodywork is good under that paint. he doesn't mention new metal, so who knows what's down there."
297,"January 7, 2005 10:45AM",Mr_Shiftright,"no way. junkyard. i agree, looks fake, wrong engine/trans combo, too much damage, not worth restoring. you can buy these in nice shape all day long with 327/autos. it's the clean 4-speeds with real options that everyone wants.

 

mark shifty's words, once the muscle car craze contracts (as it soon will) the cars that will really take the beating are the clones and the wannabees. the ""real"" cars with the ""best"" options will do okay but those poor folks who poured money into second-tier muscle cars with no real sex appeal are going to be sorry."
298,"January 7, 2005 10:59AM",andre1969,"would a '69 camaro with a 350 have in it? would that still be the 2-speed powerglide? or would they have put a thm350 or thm400 behind that one?

 

i actually wouldn't care about the car being automatic if it had a 3-speed auto, but those 2-speed automatics are really annoying, unless you have a really huge engine that doesn't care how many or few gears it has!"
299,"January 7, 2005 12:53PM",Mr_Shiftright,"best thing i would advise on camaros of that era is to buy a 6 cylinder car with no rust, gut it, take off the front clip, paint it with a good street paint job, do the suspension, upgrade the brakes, install a crate engine and a good auto or 4 speed, then put the front clip back on when you've done all your fitting. then you have a nice clone that you can drive and have fun with. also you ""know what you got"" and if you're careful you aren't in a lot of money here."

my '67 was a 6 cyl powerglide (first and last at i ever owned), that was shot when i got it in '79. no trunk floor or rear fenders to speak of.

 

a 350 '69 had some sort of thm tranny.

my uncle initially drove it from pa to ca, then it lived the rest of its life in ca. iirc, the camaro got sold for, of all things, a vega! can't remember why he did such a fool thing."
302,"January 7, 2005 1:33PM",andys120,"""can't remember why he did such a fool thing.""

303,"January 7, 2005 1:36PM",andre1969,"a lot of people did things with their cars that would seem foolish today. my mom bought a '66 catalina convertible, brand-new, when she was only 17.

 

by 1972, she was married and had me, and didn't like the idea of driving a small child around in a convertible. well there was that, and the fact that my dad would drive that car pretty hard, and i think the brakes were shot.

 

but anyway, my grandparents had a '68 impala 4-door hardtop with a 327 (dunno if it was a 2-speed or 3-speed automatic, though), and they were thinking about getting a new car. so they did a swap with my mom, and then traded the catalina in on a new '72 impala 4-door hardtop with a 350-2bbl. i was too young to remember the catalina, but i do remember the '68 impala, vaguely. i'm sure the catalina was much cooler, though!"
304,"January 7, 2005 2:15PM",michaellno,"i suppose the 2nd oil crisis of '79 might have had something to do with it, but i seem to remember that he had that car for at least a few years, then got the vega, which he rebuilt pretty much from scratch. that got traded in on a olds cutlass 2 door (early 80's vintage, i think) when he went into the air force. of course, he got sent to germany, so the cutlass stayed in the us.

 

ah, the cars we wish we (or our parents, or some other relative) had hung on to!

 

my uncle had a late 60's datsun 1600 roadster for a while .. i really wanted that, but he ended up selling it and started a relationship with a series of volvo sedans."

like the '55 chevy 2-door sedan my mother had until 1961. ok, it wasn't a bel air, and it had only the six and a 3-speed, but still...it was sky blue with a white roof...gorgeous.

 

she sold it to my uncle who passed it down to his son (my cousin). the last time i saw it was in about 1964.

 

and yes andre, the '66 pontiacs were definitely cooler than the '68 chevys! any full-size pontiac from 1961-66 is beautiful in my book, as was the 1969. the tempest/lemans/gtos also were lookers from 1964-72."
306,"January 7, 2005 2:53PM",fintail,"or the beautiful white on red 61 impala convert my mother had some time before i was born. she paid $800 for it!

307,"January 7, 2005 3:20PM",andys120,"my family's taste in cars has always been entirely pedestrian and unexciting. the coolest car my folks ever had was a '68 firebird 326 (which they hated and traded in on a buick ca. '73.) other than that it was a dreary procession of lackluster 4-doors and pimped up coupes (like the aforementioned buick regal).

 

i've already owned way more cool cars than they've ever had."
308,"January 7, 2005 4:07PM",ghulet,"...i dunno if this has been established here or not, but unless they transplanted a 327/pg in a real ss (unlikely), that ss is a fake. unlike impalas (up to '68, anyway), where one could buy the ss equipment with any engine (even a six), '67-69 camaros with ss equipment automatically had the 295-300hp (4-barrel) 350 as the base engine, with any of two or three 396s as upgrades.

 

in any case, i wouldn't advise junking it, the car looks fairly decent despite the underbody rust. too nice for a parts car. at $12k for a base car with no notable interesting options and lots of underbody rust, though, i can't see putting a bunch more money into it. this car isn't beyond hope, it's just overpriced."
309,"January 7, 2005 4:48PM",blh7068,"""the coolest car my folks ever had was a '68 firebird 326""

 

not to nitpick...

 

if it was a '68 the base v-8 was the 350...'67 (the first year of the bird) was the only year the 326 could be had in that car, and consequently was the last year for the pontiac 326."
310,"January 7, 2005 5:31PM",andys120,"well it was definitely a 326 so it must have been the first time that my folks have ever been early adopters :_)

 

they owned a pontiac before that that was semi-cool,

a 389 catalina 4-door ht. we had to lobby my dad heavily to get him to go for the ht over the dowdy posted sedan.

 

  the fact that the car would spin tires in second gear was as much because of the bias ply

whitewalls as the prodigious torque of the 389 (it's not like it was a tri-power or anything.)"
311,"January 7, 2005 5:44PM",andre1969,"here's one that really gets my goat (and no, i'm not talking gto here...) okay, you all know how much i love '57 mopars, right?

 

well, my mom's first car was a 1957 plymouth! she bought it in 1965, for like 75 bucks. and she hated it! she doesn't remember much about it, except that ""it was gray, and it was big"". out of all the wild and erotic colors available in the 50's, leave it to my mother to find a gray one! and she also remembers that one of the windows shattered when a door got slammed too hard!

 

but she doesn't remember what engine it had, what series it was, what body style, or anything! it was just a car that she got because she needed some cheap wheels, but she hated it the whole time she had it.

 

and to think that she'd ultimately have a son who, if he had something like that, would cherish it! even if it was just some cheap plaza 4-door sedan with a 6-cyl!

 

anyway, after the plymouth, she had a pink and black '59 rambler station wagon. i think she paid about $200-300 for that one. then she got the catalina.

 

and, in being a typical mother, she had a fit when i bought my '67 catalina! carried on about me having convertible, and how dangerous they are, and all that fun stuff. funny how parents forget the things they had and did when they were younger...

 

one thing though, i guess, is that my family's cars didn't get too emasculated in the 70's. the '68 impala gave way to a '75 lemans sport coupe with a pontiac 350. i'm guessing it was just a base 2-bbl model. i actually hated that car as a kid. i think it was partly because it was this loud bronzish copperish color (a color that's common again nowadays, you see it alot on neons and muranos and such), and even back then, i tended to like blues and non-pukey greens. another issue, though, might have been that square/rectangular headlights, and more squared-off, conservative styling in general, started to become much more prevalent in 1976, and here we were in this flambouyant thing that had curves up the wazoo and these big round singular headlights in an ugly color that just seemed so out of place. and that thing really looked ancient by 1980, when she traded it on a new malibu coupe that appeared throughly modern, well-proportioned, and up-to-date. and in a color i liked better: medium blue. mom actually let me pick out the color on that one ;-)

 

looking back though, i think now i'd rather have the lemans. although considering the added weight, i doubt it's 350 was much quicker than the malibu with its 229 v-6."
312,"January 7, 2005 5:46PM",andre1969,"if it makes ya feel better, my '67 catalina can spin its tires going into second gear too, and it has radials! ;-) sometimes if i try really hard, i can get it to chirp going into 3rd, as well!"
313,"January 7, 2005 8:58PM",210delray,"about the perceived lack of safety of your '67 catalina, you could tell your mother that even though it has only lap belts and no rollover protection, its ""road-hugging weight"" will protect you quite well in a collision with an average-size modern car! and it even has a collapsible steering column.

 

just don't hit a dodge ram!"
314,"January 7, 2005 9:04PM",210delray,"my aunt bought one new; it was a red savoy 4-door sedan with a black and white cloth and vinyl interior. i think the black cloth had some silvery threads in it. it was a six with whatever auto transmission came with that lowly engine.

 

great looking car, but she had a lot of trouble with it (too young to remember the details), and traded it in for a '59 ""batwing"" chevy bel air 4-door sedan. she never went back to mopar again.

 

i understand now that the plymouth six was a hoary old side-valve design that made a lot of noise but not much power."
315,"January 7, 2005 11:30PM",scscars,
316,"January 8, 2005 12:16AM",scscars,"oops! sorry about the earlier post. this is a great discussion.

 

in my family, my parents didn't go for ""cool"" cars as they were partial to plymouth station wagons, including a '65 fury iii that i ultimately wound up with. but, i had an uncle that did own at least three cars that i would buy in a heartbeat if anything close to them turned up in hemmings or at an auction.

 

when i was growing up, my uncle was partial to thunderbirds. his first was a white '59. i'm not sure of the engine that it came with. it was either a 352 or 390. big for its day and quick. even though i was just 5 years old then, i knew then that i wanted a t-bird just based on that white '59.

 

the '59 was traded 3 years later for a gold '62 with a black ""landau"" roof. that car had a steering wheel that swiveled out of the driver's way when the drivers door was opened. back then, i thought that was cooler than elvis! the '62 was powered by a 390 engine that was great on the highway.

 

a few years later, the '62 wound up being traded for a metallic sky blue '67 with a black landau roof, suicide doors, and a 428. just before i turned 16, i made my uncle an offer on this beauty, but he wouldn't sell. instead, he traded it for an ugly looking '70 t-bird in nutmeg and white. by then, t-birds had become just another luxoboat, and i wasn't interested in it.

 

a few years ago, a co-worker where i worked owned a '63 t-bird convertible with a tonneau cover(!) that was her pride and joy. the car wasn't for sale, and every summer i see her husband driving it around town. lucky guy!"
317,"January 8, 2005 12:56PM",gsemike,never had anything remotely cool. they were typical city folk. never had a car until they were married and then always went for staid family cars. my dad had a capri with a stick for a few years. that kind of broke the mold but that's it. it's unbelievable that my brother and i turned out to be the auto enthusiasts that we are. that must be a long island thing.
318,"January 8, 2005 4:55PM",ghulet,"....mine didn't have anything too fun when they were married ('68-78), lemme think, a '64 bug, '71 datsun 510, '72 chevy pickup, then one or the other had a '74 civic, '80 fiat brava, '81 vw scirocco, '87 944, '88 300e, mazdas, a hyundai, lots of strange foreign stuff. the closest my parents had to the big american land yachts i like was my stepdad's '69 impala four-door hardtop (bought from mom's co-worker for $50!!)."
319,"January 8, 2005 6:40PM",andre1969,"had a few cool cars, but unfortunately most of them were either pos-editions when he got them, or he soon turned them into that!

 

i get the order mixed up sometimes, but i think his first car was a '64 ford galaxie 500 2-door hardtop with a 390. he's told me that he hated that car when he had it because it was a ford and he wanted an ss 409 sooo bad. but in retrospect, he says it was probably the best car he ever had!

 

after that came a '63 impala ss409, the 425 hp version. it had a 4-speed. i think that one set him back like $1600, when it was only 2 years old. i guess even back then, if it had a stick, it depreciated like a rock! wouldn't an ss409 be pretty expensive new, even a stripper? he did a few annoying things with it though, like putting 6-cylinder badges on the fenders, and a hood scoop from a '63 or so plymouth or dodge.

 

after that he had a '65 impala ss, which i think had a 396. also a 4-speed. i think that one threw a rod or something like that. it had been pretty ragged when he got it.

 

then he went on to a '62 corvette. i remember this car only vaguely. i know he hit a taxi cab with it, which broke a taillight on the cab but shattered the fiberglass fender and door on the vette! and it had a big happy face painted on the underside of the hood, for whatever reason.

 

then there was a '64 gto 2-door post. i still remember the night be brought this one home. my mom and me followed him, and i could see sparks showering from under the car from the exhaust or something dragging. it was a primer grayish-black. i was actually afraid of that car as a kid! i think he paid $400 for it, and sold it for $400 awhile later.

 

the last thing i remember him driving was a light metallic green '71 torino 4-door that he inherited when my great granddad died around 1977. by that time, mom & dad were separated. i'm sure my dad hated driving something that mundane that screamed ""family"" after all those other cars he had, but at this point he just needed some wheels.

 

he moved to florida in '78, maybe early '79. i forget what happened to that ford. i think the 289 or 302 or whatever it had in it simply expired. the last car he had, which i never saw, but heard about, was a 1966 pontiac executive 4-door hardtop, metallic blue with a white painted (not vinyl) top. then along comes a dui, and away goes that car. i think that was in 1984.

 

now, he drives a 2003 buick regal ls. nice, conservative silver family car that pretty much flies under the radar, although the way dad drives now, i think the cops would overlook him if he were in a ferrari with dead tags! he's told me a few times that if he had bought a car like this when he was younger, it would have kept him out of an awful lot of trouble over the years!

 

he'll still look through the paper in the antiques and classics section though, to see what's out there. today he told me about this ad, which i quote, verbatim...

 

""desoata '55 -- complete car w/ numerous extra parts, hemi engine, $800."" that's all i know about it, but the phone # indicates that it's pretty close to me. i'm thinking about going to at least check it out. i think it's funny though, that they can't spell the name of their own car, but they know it has a hemi in it! although whomever wrote the ad at the paper couldv'e mis-spelled it i guess."
320,"January 9, 2005 8:27AM",andys120,"wouldn't an ss409 be pretty expensive new, even a stripper?

 

yes and no, andre. the 409/425 motor itself was probably $500-600 which was a healthy but not unreasonable amount in those days.

 

the ss option itself was mostly trim on the early cars, consequently not more than $200 or $300. the fact that your dad's car was an impala ss with the top optional engine and four-speed would suggest that it probably had other nice options on it but not neccessarily. everything was ala carte back then, even gearing.

 

i'd guess the car stickered around $5,000 new which was healthy change when a stripper biscayne could be had for perhaps $3300, iirc (it was a long time ago, bro)."

dunno how much non-stock drivetrain and wheels detract from the ultimate value of a nomad."
336,"January 19, 2005 2:27PM",stickguy,"on that nomad, they already killed the originality. might as well throw on modern suspension and brakes and turn it into a real resto mod.

337,"January 19, 2005 4:13PM",andre1969,"on that nomad that they swapped the engine, as long as they swapped it with something similar. for instance, pulling out one chevy smallblock and putting in another one, i don't really mind. in my mind, the real bastardization starts when they try to put in an oldsmobile block or a mopar block or a ford block. or a chevy big-block.

 

the thing that bugs me though, is when they start messing with the interior, as they did with this one. my first thought with something like that is now much would it cost to fix it back the way it should be?

 

now that being said, i think i'll go clear the snow off of my '68 dart 270 with the '69 dart gt door panels and carpet, and the early 70's a-body vinyl interior ;-)"

back in the early 90s when my dad was experiencing his old car bug, he knew a guy with a similar nomad, a black and white 57 with a 350 and rallye wheels. othwerwise, it was pretty stock - interior included, and well done. i remember the guy wanted $25k for it, which i thought was outrageous for a car with incorrect details."

also, i think a 389 in a '64 grand prix is a pretty basic engine. now if it were a 421, it might be worth something! so basically here, i'd say maybe $1500-2000 in its current condition?"
341,"January 19, 2005 6:48PM",andys120,"yup, base motor for the '63-'64 gps was the redoubtable 389. it's really kinda hard to gauge what a pretty good car with a duff engine might be worth.

i like the looks of those by the way.

 

the only thing i hate about a car not running is that it doesn't give you a chance to check out what else might be wrong with it. depending on what's wrong with it, maybe a rebuild, maybe just pull another motor and drop her in. i could live with it if everything else checked out."
343,"January 19, 2005 7:02PM",fintail,"yeah, i guess i meant to say at the price. the car certainly is not beyond hope. i wonder if an engine can really be redone for around 2 grand? i am used to mbs where the parts alone will run you more than that.

344,"January 19, 2005 7:47PM",seminole_kev,"unless there is something critically wrong with that motor, you should be able to at least have it servicable and running for under $2k. for $2k i could probably have the engine nice and slightly built up if it isn't just trashed."

346,"January 19, 2005 11:10PM",Mr_Shiftright,"spider veloces are worth some money but i don't think that much money. i'd value the car at about $28k but if it were a trophy winning restoration of such superb quality that one could deem it faultless throughout, well maybe $35k.

 

the most valuable alfas are pre 1958 because that's the cut off date for many prestigious european re-creations of historical races.

 

the 1300 is a little screamer. you can rev that engine and bend the tach needle on its peg, up to 8,000 rpm or so if you are daring enough.

 

it's a really really fun car.

 

but geesh, $45k i'd buy a ferrari 328, an mgb and fly around the world with what's left."
347,"January 20, 2005 6:03AM",andre1969,"are too terribly expensive to rebuild, or very hard to find a replacement. after all, the majority of them came in just two sizes: 389 cid from 1959-1966 and 400 cid from 1967-1979. there was a scattering of 421's and 428's thoughout the 60's, but these were mainly limited production, high-output engines.

 

pontiac built a lot of full-sized cars in the 60's, and the vast majority of them were 389/400's. it's not like chevy, where the cars ran the gamut from a 6-cyl on up through a bunch of underpowered smallblocks, then a bunch of nicely powered ones, and a scattering of big blocks.

 

i think the pontiac block is what's unofficially known as a ""medium"" block. bigger than something like a chevy smallblock, so it's going to be more durable and able to take more stress, but still lighter and smaller than something like a chevy big-block. i've heard that once you get to the 455 range though, they tended to be more fragile than a buick or olds 455.

 

anyway though, while they're not as common as something like a chevy smallblock or mopar 318 or slant six, they're still pretty easy and cheap to get parts for."

is it one of those things where they basically just made a raised-deck version for the larger displacement engines? i know that's what mopar did with their big blocks. in fact, they were designated as b- (350, 361, 383, 400) and rb- (another version of the 383 that was used only in chryslers for '59-60, 413, 426, 440). oldsmobile did it with their rocket v-8 too, at least on the 403, compared to the smaller engines like the 260, 307, and 350."

352,"January 21, 2005 8:40AM",seminole_kev,"i wouldn't pay that much for a falcon just out of principle, but i don't really have a problem with ford's c4 automatic tranny. wouldn't be my first choice, but it isn't a bad one. might be getting a little close in power to where maybe they should have gone with a c6 tranny (if you want to go the automatic route) but i don't know.

 

still, for a falcon that doesn't have the original motor, eh....i'll give him $4,500 for it if it is as nice as he says."
353,"January 21, 2005 8:58AM",andre1969,"it might actually be overkill for that little falcon. these things were originally designed to be lightweight economy cars, and as far as i know, no compact falcon ever got anything bigger than a 260 or a mild 289. while the falcon nameplate lasted through ""1970 1/2"", the 1966 and onward falcons were actually based on the heavier, beefier intermediate fairlane, a platform that could handle a big block without too much strain.

 

those earlier falcons are so tiny and lightweight that it's actually scary! some of the earlier models were as light as 2200 lb! with a gas tank about 2 inches off the rear bumper!

 

still, that '64's a cool little car, and depending on the condition, i'd probably go with about what kev says. depends too on the condition of the interior. from what i can tell, it looks like it has a high-back bucket seat in there, or someting with a headrest. that and the tinted rear windows tip me off that the interior may have been modified more than i'd care to see!"
354,"January 21, 2005 11:44AM",Mr_Shiftright,"if it's a real falcon sprint futura it's worth the money. spot on market price, although the mods might knock 10-15% off that, depending on who wants it. i'd appraise it (presuming the work is well done top and bottom) at around $6,000.

 

hopefully, there are some brakes and suspension under there beyond the 1936 buick technology of an original falcon.

 

i agree, a c6 would have been better and a 4-speed better yet."
355,"January 21, 2005 12:12PM",seminole_kev,"even without the original motor, or even the correct displacement motor? maybe i'm just a little bit too much a stickler on that?"
356,"January 21, 2005 2:00PM",fintail,"reminds me of that red on red 63 sprint i wanted to get for my first car but the old guy wouldn't sell. it had a 260 iirc, and was original, being a one owner car. it was pretty neat."
357,"January 21, 2005 9:37PM",Mr_Shiftright,"look, it's a falcon, not a corvette. nobody much cares what motor is in it except falcon ""purists"" and really, how can you say that in a crowd with a straight face?

 

however, all kidding aside, a totally original sprint would be worth more, but not a lot more unless it was a documented 4-speed with lots of options.

 

you see the same phenomenon even in ""common"" mustangs (the coupes) or small block camaros. the only time an original motor really matters a lot on price is when it's either a big block or a very special motor (like the 271 in the mustang fastback or the 302 in the z28).

 

but if someone puts a 350 crate in a 307 camaro, nobody is going to assign a huge penalty, or a 289 in a 260 early mustang coupe---these cars are so common it doesn't seem to impact the type of buyer who just wants to go fast for cheap.

 

look at it another way. if you want a clean, early to mid 60s v8 american coupe that's all trimmed out and ready to roll, how much cheaper do you think you're gonna get than $6k, original or not. you can't even get a beater 69 chevelle for that anymore."

no price given. i wonder what's worth, and what the heck is a ""rotisserie restoration?"
359,"January 22, 2005 11:09AM",Mr_Shiftright,"it's when you put the car on a rotating frame device so that you can spin it completely around in a circle (longitudinally) and work on any part of the chassis or sheet metal.

 

the ""idea"" is that if you say rotisserie that means you have supposedly done a very thorough job.

 

what it's worth depends on a lot of factors we don't know----authenticity, documentation of that authenticity, and quality of workmanship. if any of those are lacking or in place, the price could vary wildly. it's the type of car you have to inspect carefully to appraise properly/

 

the level of fraud, counterfeiting, deception, skullduggery, ignorance, greed and irresponsible hyperbole is reaching epic proportions in the old car hobby. you had better reallly know what you're doing.

 

i hear about one heartache story a day right now.

 

the latest: man buys a ""restored"" 1969 porsche 911e (fairly desirable older porsche)....so he brings it to my friends shop and we find that the front belly pan is re-inforced with welded bars from an old mattress frame....being a uni-body type of car, totally rotted out, it is not repairable and thus $12,000 worth of car is now absolute junk."

363,"January 23, 2005 12:54PM",Mr_Shiftright,"could someone help me come up with a mathematical formula that can be applied to project cars. in other words, i'll provide the basic requirements of the equation and you all help me put it in mathematical terms.

 

for instance, the numberical condition of the project car as it sits when you buy it could be ccp (class of condition presently).

 

the condition you wish to achieve could be ccf (classic condition future)

 

the amount of money it takes to get from the ccp to the ccf could be expressed as ei (estimated investment)

 

so a simple formula would be ccp + ie = ccf

 

however, we aren't done. we need to have more variables and we may need to multiply and divide things. this is where i get stuck in math.

 

other factors for the equation

 

once we have (ccp+ie) maybe we have to divide that by the current cost of an existing car in the condition you want the project car to be (let's call that dc, or duplication cost). in other words, maybe we could come up with an index to tell us that if (ccp + ie) is greater than dc.

 

thus, by calculating an index and giving the index results a ""weight"", we could decide how rational our project is.

 

what we need to know here:

 

1. accurate assessment of the car's current 'class of condition, from #6 (parts car) to #1 (show car)

 

2. reasonable assessment of how much it will cost to get to where we want to go with the car

 

3. accurate market value of an already existing duplicate car in the condition we'd like our project to be.

 

4. the base line of our index, that is 1.0 is ""break even"", 1.2 isn't so good, 1.5 is nuts, .8 is very good, .5 is a brilliant idea, etc.

 

any further ideas on this notion?

 

if any of you math whizzes can come up with a formula, then we'll pick out a real car and apply it see how good it is. if it doesn't seem to work, we can adjust it or add other variables to the equation.

 

but let's not get too crazy. i can't solve for three unknowns or anything and i'd like to keep to quantifiable values, rather than ""i like it"". let us presume that current market value has already determined ""desirability"" for most people.

 

this formula can't work for people who want to spend $100,000 on a pacer because they were born in the back seat of one or because it was our first car. well, you could use the formula but you already know the result beforehand."

funny about the lark. there was a '64(?) featured today on my classic car (with dennis gage). had a s/c avanti motor on it, worked over a bit, all factory supposedly. called it ""plain brown wrapper"". looked very tame, and was dark brown. they ran it against a yenko camaro, and it almost one (ran in the 12s)."

the duesenberg's value is based strictly on provenance, documented history and complete authentication as to originality. museum cars are generally a red flag on any collectible car. they suffer from benign neglect, no exercise and little maintenance. they are basically statues.

373,"January 26, 2005 9:04AM",Mr_Shiftright,"re: mustang convertibles.

 

1st gen mustang convertibles can bring big money if they are really really nice and not messed with. i'd say the ""active range"" for #2s is in the low $20ks. a price of $32k sounds high and a one-time thing.

 

the car in question for $16.5 is a bit doubtful. if you read the ad carefully you will see that what the dealer is saying is that the car has been ""clipped"", that is, an entire rear clip from another car has been welded on (at least this is what i think). also, we have ""nice paint"" but ""worn carpets"". what's with that?

 

what i see here is a make-over and budget resto of a tired car. i could be wrong but that's what i ""smell"" from years of ""smelling"".

 

i'd say true value is much closer to $12k if the car looks really good and runs out great and has no needs. a driver. rev it up, bang it up, have a good time. this is not one to save in the wine cellar.

 

as seminole says, an old mustang can't really eat you alive. they are simple cars, basically just a falcon with another body, and a falcon is basically just a 1936 buick with a few improvements. so you can't go too wrong, and parts are available everywhere.

 

only downside is that you might end up with a ""bitsa"" car, with pieces bought from all over, ,and it will drive like a kit car rather than one that was ""all of a piece"" from the factory.

 

old mustangs of the mid 60s are fun to drive and plenty adequate for modern roads. just don't think you are in a ""sports car""."

sure, if you're running ep or hp in scca, you can gut an mgb and do these things, but taking a nice original (and early) mgb and pimping it out doesn't work for me.

398,"February 8, 2005 3:29PM",lemmer,"hold on!

 

we didn't vote on the vw/z-28. i say yes as the ""mickey thompson wheels and tires are valued at over $5500 alone."" the porsche engine is worth at least another couple of thousand.

401,"February 8, 2005 5:14PM",Mr_Shiftright,"a porsche engine may indeed be more expensive to rebuild than a vw engine but you won't be rebuilding it every 60,000 miles (or far fewer if it's a ""hotrod"" vw aka ""hand grenade engine"".

 

so really, for every 4 vw engines you build you get to build one porsche engine, so it works out close to the same thing."
402,"February 9, 2005 10:45AM",oregonboy,"i noticed that the porsche engine is a 4-cyl. doubtless a 912 engine... which is pretty sweet in a 912, but in that abortion?

 

no wait! it could be a 914 engine (!) does the seller ever mention that this thing is s-l-o-w?? with the bed-liner paint job and those oversized tires it must be fairly heavy.

the 912 motor was just an adapted 356 motor and this could be a 356 motor as well.

404,"February 9, 2005 6:42PM",Mr_Shiftright,"that's correct, the 914 engine is just a 412 engine. so if you rebuild it, you get vw performance at porsche prices. such a deal!"

s' funny, it's described a dark maroon but photo appears to show a purple car, at least on my monitor. seems like a semi-reasonable price assuming the body and paint work is good, what say you guys?"
416,"February 14, 2005 7:35AM",stickguy,"certainly worth saving. even looks like it has one of them hood tachs (or at least the hole for it). maybe a little pricey, depends on how nice the work is, and what the ""20% left"" consists of. seems like the hard work is done.

 

of course, i'm always leery of easy to finish projects that the owner doesn't want to finish. seems like he would make out better if he just completed it, or had someone do it.

 

it is purple by the way. if it was a better color, and done tastefully, and someone offered it to me for 5k, i'd probably buy it."
417,"February 14, 2005 8:03AM",andre1969,"but what engine would it have in it? i see where it says ""4-speed"", but i don't see an engine size listed. definitely has potential though, even with that plum crazy color! i think that color would look better if it had either black or white accent stripes somewhere."
418,"February 14, 2005 8:22AM",gsemike,"that color would be great on a cuda but if this was mine, it'd be getting repainted again (probably black). it's missing the hood tach and those look like buick wheels but it looks decent if the owner would pony up more thorough details.

 

from the way the front is sitting, could it be motorless?"
419,"February 14, 2005 8:23AM",andys120,"but what engine would it have in it?

 

good question, andre. i think '67 was the last year for the 326 so i guess the default engine would be the 350. i assume they'd have mentioned it if it had the 400 in it.

 

unless it had the sohc six (?)"
420,"February 14, 2005 9:05AM",stickguy,"that must be a v8 car. i doubt it has an original, or probably even correct, motor, but that wouldn't bother me on a car like this, assuming it had a good one!

 

i bet the sprint motor would cost way more than a good small block though."
421,"February 14, 2005 10:11AM",Mr_Shiftright,"sprint motor parts are very hard to find, and it's not a good motor anyway. i think putting in a v8 would probably increase the car's value.

 

looks overpriced for what it is and how far you might still have to go. you can buy nice firebird coupes all ready to go for not too much more than that.

 

firebirds, unless they are big-engined and original, do not bring camaro money, and one should pay accordingly.

 

when someone else has started a restoration, the selling price is heavily dependent on the quality of the workmanship. the mention of ""new floor pans"" is a little scary unless the body was actually removed and chemically treated or bead blasted.

 "
422,"February 14, 2005 12:28PM",andys120,"""new floor pans..."" rust and pony cars go together like a horse and carriage."
423,"February 14, 2005 1:30PM",andre1969,"but i've heard that the '67-69 firebird/camaro, along with the '68-79 nova and possibly the '70 1/2-81 camaro/firebird have unibodies designed in such a way that when they get rusty enough, the car can actually break in two at the firewall. i think it has something to do with the subframe rails not extending far enough under the passenger cabin, as they would on a mopar of that vintage.

 

i think it had something to do with trying to completely isolate the sub-frame and engine/suspension from the passenger compartment? i think it made for a smoother ride, but would cause long-term integrity problems."
424,"February 14, 2005 3:24PM",stickguy,"up, you can unbolt the front clip on a nova and just roll it right away, frame rails and all."
425,"February 14, 2005 4:05PM",ghulet,"...the seller didn't mention the engine size on that firebird, or whether or not it's original. if it has a factory hood tach, it almost certainly was a v8 car. no matter, this car doesn't look to be anything special, and 'matching numbers', etc. don't seem to be so important on firebirds, unless they're trans ams or maybe 400s. i agree with shiftright, one can probably buy a super nice 60s firebird coupe (again, not a trans am, big block or high option car) for around $10k, so why spend $8k on one needing what looks to be quite a lot of work?"
426,"February 14, 2005 4:27PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i've seen ""plain"" coupes go for even less than that in very decent condition. figure $8.5k-12k is the active range for nice but not show cars. so his $8k is looking pretty bad unless it were a matching numbers big block.

 

if it's really 80% done, then it's worth about 80% of what he is asking."
427,"February 15, 2005 12:36PM",Mr_Shiftright,"what does he think he has here, a 60s ferrari? it's a $500 car at best the way it sits. it needs everything looks like. at what's the end point? you can buy good runners for $3,500 and pristine cars for $6,500. and to think you're only paint, bodywork, upholstery and mechanicals away from untold riches!

what a dummy. he should have put it at no reserve and start at $1 and he'd be over his starting bid on the first couple days already.

somebody should e-mail him and give him a clue. it would be nice to find a home for the car."
428,"March 1, 2005 10:53AM",andre1969,"but i like it:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/ebayisapi.dll?viewitem&category- =6190&item=4531506162

i think $1800 is kinda high, though, considering it's just a 4-door and it needs floors, a trunk, windshield, brake work, and interior. and i really can't tell from the pics, but i'm sure it's a cheap paint job. i doubt it was originally red either, considering the interior looks to be a sea green!

the '57-58 desoto is one of my favorite cars, but i always thought the cheap firesweep series was a bit of a mutt. the desoto grille just doesn't work on the dodge front-end clip!

so what say ye all? save it or part it out?"
429,"March 1, 2005 11:23AM",blh7068,"""the seller didn't mention the engine size on that firebird, or whether or not it's original.""

actually ghulet, he did- nom usually means ""not original motor"" but yes he doesnt indicate size.

shifty's right- 1st gen firebird cars dont bring as much as the camaro unless its a 400 car, and even there a camaro in like condition may be more pricey(trans am didnt show up until 69). also finding a nice 'bird will be tougher than the camaro as they made many more of the chevy
counterpart.

now on the other hand-
early second gen t/a's('70-'72 and to a lesser extent '73)have been spiraling out of control price wise the last few years. a fine example of one of these t/a's will command a lot more money than a like vintage z-28.

keep in mind the firebirds/ta's didn't start outselling the camaro/z-28 until the late 70's when smokey and the bandit hit the silver screen."
430,"March 1, 2005 11:41AM",Mr_Shiftright,"you'll have to paste the entire url that andre posted to get it to work. somehow part of it is ""live"" and part isn't.

the '57 desoto doesn't make sense at this price since it is a ""base"" car and a sedan to boot, meaning that you should be able to find a clean driver for $5,000 all ready to go.

but for a hobby, and if the price stays around $1,800, not much harm done. the only problem is that you don't have much when you're done--it's still a bottom of the line 4 door sedan and not too pretty either.

if it were me and i wanted a desoto, i'd pick a fireflite 2 door hardtop or wagon--this helps to justify your investment. i'd use all the 4-doors for parts cars for the higher line cars."
431,"March 1, 2005 11:51AM",andre1969,"i tried to go back several times to join that url together in the message, but it just wouldn't work. just out of curiosity, is there much difference in value these days between a fireflite and a firedome 2-door hardtop?

i don't know if it really makes much difference in the old car market, but for me at least, either the firedome or fireflite is much preferable to the firesweep. not only better looking, but much better performing. the firedome/fireflite had a 341 hemi with 270 or 295 hp, and most, if not all, had the excellent, fast-shifting torqueflite tranny. in contrast, the firesweep just had a dodge 325 poly, with 245 hp (2-bbl) or 260 (4-bbl), and every one i've ever seen was mated up to either a 2-speed powerflite, or a 3 on the tree! i've heard the dodge 325 is also pretty doggy, at least in 2-bbl form with the 2-speed tranny.

i almost bought a '58 firesweep back in '95 for $850. it was white with a yellow spear/roof. it was still stuck with the 2-speed tranny, but it had a 2-bbl 350 wedge with 280 hp, and that sucker would really move. unfortunately, someone else beat me to it, but i still got a chance to drive it!

for some reason, i always thought it would be cool to get one of these cheaper, less-desireable desotos to drive around on a regular basis. that way, if something happened to it, i wouldn't be crying over it as much as i would if something happened to my '57 firedome!"
432,"March 1, 2005 5:32PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well true. the 4-door version of just about any car is usually the most plentiful and therefore the most expendable and therefore the least collectible.

there are only a handful of 4-door cars that have become, or will ever become, what we call ""collectible"".

(it helps if it has a huge engine)."
433,"March 2, 2005 12:34PM",andre1969,"this is a sad looking beast!

http://makeashorterlink.com/?g6181279a

a guy in my mopar club mentioned that the current bid of $1525 is about what he paid for one back in 1972!

looks like this thing might be good for a few parts here and there, but otherwise i'd say junk it!"
434,"March 2, 2005 1:26PM",lemko,...and not many at that. all the body panels are either badly dented or rusted. maybe you could salvage a few minor bits here and there. sad.
435,"March 2, 2005 1:55PM",stickguy,"i suppose you could take the chassis for the vin and build a new car on it. might even be fun. nothing to save on this beast, though i would pay $20 for the r/t grill piece."
436,"March 2, 2005 3:45PM",Mr_Shiftright,"that's exactly why the price is what it is...for the vin and papers...this car's papers will show up on some other chassis soon enough, or it will be made into a fake. a ""real"" '69 charger 440 six pack is worth an easy $50k right now, so there's wiggle room in here."
437,"March 3, 2005 6:49AM",gsemike,"that pile is up to $1,600. besdies the glass and the papers, what is worth saving? maybe if you won the auction, the seller would send you the glass, grills and papers and leave the rest on the curb for garbage pickup.

if you leave two pieces a week on the curb, the whole thing would be gone in about two months."
438,"March 3, 2005 7:48AM",andre1969,"the driver's side fender and door aren't too bad either, and the decklid and bumper. i have no idea how much that kind of stuff would sell for nowadays. the last time i bought a door from a junkyard, it was off of a '79 pontiac lemans. a buddy of mine with a '78 malibu snagged his rear door on a guardrail pulling out from work one night, and tore it up real good. i got him this door for about 50 bucks. that was a good 12-13 years ago though, and i'm sure that '69 charger parts are a bit more desireable than late 70's gm 4-doors!"
439,"March 3, 2005 8:45AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i think it's all about the vin plates and papers...i think that's what's for sale here but of course you can't say that. i agree, the rest is just scrap metal.

i wish i knew the vin--i'd put it in my database, and i'm sure i'll see it again somewhere, someday.

counterfeiting in muscle cars has gotten so bad i refuse to authenticate a car when appraising it anymore. people have gotten way too clever. without a factory build sheet i'm not signing anything....and now i hear the broadcast sheets are being counterfeited."
440,"March 3, 2005 5:27PM",fintail,"there's not much upside, but little risk, as it probably could be had for a bit less"
441,"March 3, 2005 9:56PM",Mr_Shiftright,fair enough...
442,"March 4, 2005 7:01AM",gsemike,i don't get what he's saying about the price guide but it looks like a decent enough driver. lord knows we've seen worse here for more money.
443,"March 4, 2005 7:17AM",andre1969,"is that the car's not quite a 3 on the condition scale, and not quite a 4, but still closer to the 4 end of the spectrum.

i forget how that scale runs, but i think it's something like this...

#1 absolutely perfect, trailer queen. a lot of people might think they have a #1 car, but in reality this is a mythical beast, almost never seen in the real world.

#2 what most people really have when they think they have a #1 car. car looks great and needs absolutely nothing, but still might have a very slight cosmetic blemish here and there.

#3 and #4 decent running cars that might need some body work, interior work, or mechanical work to be really nice, but are mostly useable as is. a typical used car.

#5 needs a total restoration. may or may not be running, but cannot be used as-is.

#6 parts car."
444,"March 4, 2005 7:35AM",fintail,"that sounds right to me. i think my old car is a 3...it needs a bit, but nothing serious.

some of those value guides can also be way out there. they put nice prices on fintails too.

that olds could be a good driver and not too much of a gamble at 3000-3500."
445,"March 4, 2005 9:50AM",Mr_Shiftright,"in fact, most cars you see at local shows in parking lots are #3s. a #2 car is actually a very very sharp car with no apparent defects--it's more like a #2 car is just not fanatically restored enough to be a #1. or a former #1 with a little scratch and tarnish and faded spots here and there. so a #2 might get a lower echelon trophy but a #3 never would, in a serious car show.

if a car doesn't run and hasn't run for some time and nobody can remember when it last ran, i automatically put it in #4 in most cases, since there are so many question marks. also, any car with dents or broken glass, etc., goes into #4.

#5 i reserve for rough but still complete and non-rusted cars.

if they are stripped, weathered, or badly rusted, they are #6, which is essentially to be regarded as a parts car.

the reason i might seem harsher than most guides is that an appraiser is obligated to appraise the car in front of him, as it sits. he can't presume that it will start or that the dent will be pulled out tomorrow, etc. or even that someone will wash it!"
446,"March 7, 2005 6:23PM",justdroolin,"i created a name to ask a question, this seemed to be the best place if its not then direct to somewhere that is. i'm looking for a 1965 chevy malibu station wagon figured that someone here might have better resources than i do, can anyone offer any sites that i can look through? i'm not looking for a mint condition vehicle, more like a project car."
447,"March 7, 2005 6:33PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i'd say try hemmings motor news (www.hemmings.com) and the autotrader's collector car classifieds, which is www.traderonline.com. i think those are best for project-type vehicles, because the ads are cheap.

you can also just ""google"" for a '65 wagon, and add ""for sale"" to the car's year and make and you might pick something up."
448,"March 7, 2005 8:15PM",andre1969,"when you use google, you might have better luck doing ""1965 chevelle wagon"". i'm not sure about 1965 specifically, but back then chevrolet had the habit of calling their station wagon variants somthing different from their sedans and coupes. and back then the malibu was but one trim level of the whole chevelle line. i think it went something like chevelle 300, chevelle 500, and chevelle malibu?

chevy used to name their wagons things like ""nomad"" (even in the 60's) ""brookwood"", ""kingswood"", etc. at least with the full-sized ones they did. i'm sure they did something similar with the chevelle."
449,"March 8, 2005 2:21PM",lemko,"...was called concours. the plain-jane was called nomad. brookwood was the plain-jane full-size wagon, equivalent to a biscayne or bel air sedan. the kingswood was the wagon equivalent of the impala, and the kingswood estate was the wood-appliqued caprice equivalent."
450,"April 8, 2005 5:49AM",gsemike,"if that car was local, i could see going $600 or $700 for a station car. if the mileage is really 106k, it could go for a couple of more years."
451,"April 8, 2005 9:24AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well now you know what they're really worth

i think 75-77 cars are going to be the unwanted orphans of old vehicles. it wasn't the best of times. manufacturers were mostly floundering trying to cope with the new emissions requirements in the us and mostly doing a very bad job of it. lots of mechanical-vacuum devices, (a headache), air pumps and huge engines with low hp and low compression and very touchy carburetors. you can't even hot rod 'em without gutting them. even in foreign cars, these years are generally shunned. i know 75-77 porsches are the kiss of death and of course jaguars it goes without saying. benz, too, had rough years here."
452,"April 8, 2005 9:41AM",andre1969,"of really big cars like that is that there does seem to be a small group of people that rejoice in them, and like them because they're about as big as detroit cars ever got. if i really needed a car, i'd consider it. i'd never sink a load of money trying to restore it to it's former glory, or anything like that! and the main reason that it caught my eye was those pontiac rally 2's! but as a beater to get me around, as long as there was nothing major mechanically wrong with it, i wouldn't be ashamed of it.

usually though, the type of crowd that goes for these big boats wants them as big and loaded and cushy as possible. so something like a lincoln, caddy, chrysler nyer brougham, buick electra, or olds ninety eight is what they go for. or the convertible variants of the b-body, which were last produced in '75. but not more basic stuff like a catalina, impala, or fury sedan. and this type of crowd is generally not that concerned about the power, as these cars were more cruisers than bruisers (although they'd bruise ya pretty hard if one hit you!). they're more concerned about how feature-laden and opulent the car is."
453,"April 8, 2005 10:27AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i guess if they are cheap enough...i mean, for $510 what have you got to complain about?

i drove a '75 cadillac convertible not too long ago and i think it was the worst driving, worst handling, slowest, clumsiest, rattliest, most ornery pile of metal i have ever driven in my life. the scuttle shake was unbelievable! i can still see the front hood oil-canning in and out, going bonk-boing, bonk-boing!

i find it very hard to conceive of anyone enjoying this experience, unless you like being scared a lot! but to be fair about it, i guess if you are going 35 mph in a straight line on a sunny day, well, then okay, i have no argument with that. just don't do anything real sudden like and stay off the railroad tracks.

or buy the coupe and get some stiff shocks and really great tires!"
454,"April 8, 2005 10:30AM",lemko,"...if it weren't for the rust on that catalina, i'd make a bid on it. i guess i'm one of the few that would appreciate a 1975-77 car as i had a 1975 cadillac. a 1977 jaguar? it would be the perfect car for the rich masochist who's too proud for whips and chains!"
455,"April 8, 2005 10:38AM",Mr_Shiftright,"no, at least a masochist gets pleasure from his torment...a '75 jaguar owner just gets bills. no american car could possibly have been as bad as a 1975 jaguar."
456,"April 8, 2005 10:44AM",andre1969,"that i would really love to have...a 1975 lesabre convertible, preferably in baby blue with a white interior, and the 455. i don't think the 455 was much faster than the 350 in 0-60 and quarter mile times by then, but i believe it still had a definite advantage when it came to passing power, driving fully-loaded, etc. i always had a thing for hardtops as well, both 2- and 4-door, and i think that's one reason why i liked those big mid-70's mastodons. iirc the 1978 newport/new yorker was the last domestic hardtop you could buy, 2 or 4-door. sure, there were a few cars without b-pillars after that, like the mark v, '80-83 cordoba/mirada, '79-85 gm e-body, etc, but they all had stationary rear windows.

i think the last japanese hardtop coupes, at least available in the us, were in 1983. the datsun 200sx, toyota corolla, mazda 626, and plymouth saporro/dodge challenger were all available as hardtops till around then. subaru offered one too, but i think it departed earlier. i think the only hardtops left today are mercedes benzes!"
457,"April 8, 2005 11:08AM",lemko,"...didn't those 1978 chryslers still have a vestige of a horn ring and vent windows similar to those used on a 1964-68 imperial? speaking of imperial - ""collectible automobile"" has an excellent article on the 1960-63 imperials. critics of the time didn't like them, but i think they are ultra-cool and would pay a premium for a pristine example. i would like either a 1960 or '61."
458,"April 8, 2005 11:27AM",andre1969,"i'm not sure if they did by 1978, but i think some of the earlier examples of those big '74-78 monsters might have used that horn ring. i'm not sure, but i think the '78's used the same steering wheel as my '79 nyer, which just has a padded, slightly boomerang-shaped center section. as for the vent windows, you could get them as an option in '78. i posted a picture of one here once, but got in a little trouble for it, because it was a lowrider at a car show, and it had 3 scantilly-clad women bent over the back of it! i still have the pic somewhere, i think, if you want me to email it to you! sneakers would kill me if i posted it again, though! :shades:

as for imperials, i love the '60, with its big ""smiley-face"" grille, but not so crazy about the '61-63 with those free-standing headlights. i used to really hate them in pictures, but then when i finally started seeing them in person at car shows, well they're just so ugly and gaudy and so out there that you can't help but love them!"

469,"April 11, 2005 9:39AM",andre1969,"that manheim lists a '74 gto as being worth more than a '73! i know neither one is in the same league as the earlier models, but i figured the '73 would at least be a bit more desireable.

also, they list the '74 gto has having a 350 v-8 with 250 hp. did it really have that much? the '73 had a 400 standard with 230 hp, and a 455 optional with 250 hp. there was supposed to be a super duty gto with a 455 and 310 hp that was supposedly going to put any previous gto to shame (and to be fair, 310 hp net probably is close to 400 gross), but only a few prototypes were built.

i thought the '74 gto had more like 200 hp, which sounds more realistic. with 250 i'd think it would've been a screamer for the time. after all, some of the fastest cars around back then were the 340 and 360 duster/demon/dart sports, which usually had around 240-245 hp net. the '74 gto was heavier though, even though it was a compact."
470,"April 11, 2005 9:54AM",Mr_Shiftright,"they lied a lot back then

all price guides should be taken with a grain, or a pound, of salt...but they do put you in the ballpark.

pricing with these cars is all about condition. one man's ""good"" is another man's ""fair"" so arguing prices with a real object in front of you is difficult.

the gto posted here is, to my mind, a #6 automobile and not even listed in most price guides---in other words, a parts car only.

would someone pay $1,500 for it? maybe. would that mean it was worth that? only to that person on that day, but that's not the market, no. $500 would make you a philanthropist, if you back it all up from the $10k-$12k ""clean driver""."

it's a rare car (they only made about 1,800 total grahams, sc or not, in all of 1940-41) but not very many people care about it.

if you had to have one, and couldn't find one done already, and you needed 1,000 hours of garage therapy and were an expert painter, bodyman, upholsterer and mechanic and could do the labor for free, and if you were optimistic and cheerful and resourceful and clever-----i still wouldn't do it."

side view:


interior:


it's a '74 spider. complete and original, with a rusty driver's floor but otherwise solid. i paid $2500 for it, and it came with a truckload of spares. i'm thinking i can make up half of what i paid for it by selling stuff on ebay! i've got to go pick up all the parts on saturday, but at the very least there is a complete engine, 2 transmissions, a complete rear axle with diff, extra complete and solid front and rear bumpers (these are like gold, as owners of '75-81 rubber bumper spiders covet them for swaps), marker lights, spica pumps, etc. i've wanted another spider ever since i sold my '87, but this time i wanted one with a little more classic feel. i don't plan to restore it to pebble beach standards, and i know i probably won't make a profit, but it should be fun to tinker with. my plans for this year are to replace the floor (and reseal and rustproof), and clean up the interior with new carpets and door panels. this winter i'll do the body work that's needed - not too much, from what i can see, but those are famous last words, i know - then have a decent paint job put on.

477,"April 22, 2005 10:24AM",qbrozen,"good luck with it, jason.

you may already know this since you had one, but the best deal i found when i bought my floorpans was from ebspares. then again, aftermarket parts seem to be much more plentiful for the older alfas, so you may have an easier time than i did searching for my '86."
478,"April 22, 2005 10:27AM",stickguy,"i would have taken it for $2,500, even without the spares.

wonder why the owner (who obviously wasn't looking to make a killing) didn't sell them on the side?

sounds like a wife's ultimatum might have been involved..."
479,"April 22, 2005 10:48AM",jaserb,"and decided it was time to move on to something else. in his case it was a model a pickup that had been in his family since new.

thanks for the tip on ebspares. i'll check them out.

-jason"
480,"April 22, 2005 11:26AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i think you're fine with this deal, as long as you don't overdo it. just remember that you can buy really really nice ones for $6,500, so make that your budget or go over it by maybe 20%.

if you open 'er up and find lots more rust than you thought, like eating into the a pillar where it meets the floors, bail out fast...or if you see rust attacking the mounting points for the suspension.

you may wish to hold onto the transmissions since as you know the synchros in alfas are weak. give yours a good workout to make sure you can upshift downshift okay.

you may also wish to hold onto one of the spica pumps because you must never never run out of gas in this car....the fuel helps lubricate the pump is why. also these pumps have little oil reservoirs as you probably know.

good fun car if you keep a level head about it."
481,"April 22, 2005 11:47AM",corvette,"*** ...the fuel helps lubricate the pump is why. also these pumps have little oil reservoirs as you probably know. ***

i hesitate to recommend oil and fuel additives, but there is one called fuel power that increases the lubricity of the fuel. they're quite fond of it on the oil boards. might be worth looking into."
482,"April 22, 2005 11:59AM",Mr_Shiftright,actually a dash of two-stroke oil in the gas would probably do as well for a fraction of the cost.
483,"April 22, 2005 12:57PM",jaserb,"4 oz per tank of gas, or something like that. i understand the spica system is an adaptation of a diesel injection system, and diesel lubricates far better than even leaded gas, let alone the unleaded stuff we're stuck with now. i'll probably sell the trannys. this car got new synchros about 20k miles ago, and the po used some sort of special gear oil formulation - i think it was an amsoil product. regardless, this thing shifts perfectly, even when cold. i learned to double clutch pretty well on my old - er, newer spider, so even if it starts to go i'll learn to live with it.

i looked at an ""immaculate"" '73 on ebay, even bid up to $6k. it had some things that weren't kosher in the engine bay, though, and i didn't get a good feeling about it. ended up going for $6600.

-jason"
484,"April 22, 2005 1:17PM",Mr_Shiftright,"you see a lot of clapped out alfas because the cost of restoration exceeds the value of the car. any car caught in this dilemma is likely to keep disaappearing or falling into the hands of vehicular torturers until they become so rare than the value goes up...heh...heh...maybe.

the 1981 on up alfa with bosch injection are more manageable cars but somehow your model is more fun and better looking than the whaletail models.

1750 and 2000 alfa spiders pretty much still act like used cars, that is, the older they are, the less they are worth. however, once you get to the roundtails and the duettos, the prices start to rise with age, hitting a peak around 56-57, because those spiders are eligible for prestigious european racing events."
485,"April 22, 2005 1:45PM",jaserb,"the thin bumpers and relatively free flowing engine (no smog pump, cat, egr, etc) make it more desirable than the later spica cars.

i was a bit taken aback by the power this car has. as fun as my '87 was, it didn't like to rev all that much and with all the luxury doodads (a/c, leather, pw, etc) i'm sure it was substantially heavier. fairly underpowered. the '74 is much quicker - and by much quicker, i mean it would actually give my wife's 2004 minivan a decent race. at any rate, with the skinny tires it's powerful enough to hang the tail out a bit.

-jason"
486,"April 22, 2005 4:17PM",Mr_Shiftright,"the spica cars rev better that is very true. 70-74s do indeed show a slight price advantage that is also true, but not a great deal yet....maybe top dollar $7,500 instead of $6,500. but that's a good sign, shows some interest (finally) in 70s alfas. you probably have about 15-20 more hp than the bosch injected cars but at 132 hp you would still need to go to larger valves, cams and webers to get really rolling.

probably what you are seeing in the market price is the ""bumper bump"" as i call it---all 1974 cars being worth more than '75 cars because of the hideous bumpers that most european cars put on their models to get them into the usa. also the 'smog bump' regarding cars in california."

493,"May 19, 2005 5:26AM",gsemike,"i figured that it could be worht up to $2,000 if it didn't need any work. a used tranny installed should be in the $500 range. the brakes are the wild card. are we talking pads and shoes or a whole new system? if upon inspection, it just needs relining, put that down for $300. let's even say we chop $100 off, this could work out."
494,"May 19, 2005 6:29AM",andre1969,"that a tranny ain't going to be cheap. might depend on where you live, though. last time i had to deal with a used tranny was back in 2002 when my buddy's '98 tracker pooped its tranny out. iirc, the tranny itself was around $682 with tax (a used 3-speed automatic with about 55,000 miles on it) and the installation was around $350 or so...grand total came out to less than $1100.

now from what i've heard, tracker parts like that are actually pretty expensive, since they're not that common and can be hard to track down. a ford 4-speed automatic would be more common, but also might be more expensive, being 4-speed/overdrive, and the labor of putting it in might be more, too, especially if it's 4wd.

still, for $650 it might be worth taking a chance on."
495,"May 19, 2005 7:41AM",stickguy,"a 14 yo exploder with 150k on it is going to be a money pit. i don't know about the tranny itself, but the 4wd system is major $$, and integrates with the tranny, so who knows what it really needs.

you'd have to work out the title issues, but provided that this car's milage is reasonable, this could be a very good deal. fix the back and install the airbags (notice that the passenger side is gone), and this car could be worth $10,000 no problem.

this is provided that it doesn't have a salvage title.

499,"June 2, 2005 11:53AM",stickguy,"although i do have a soft spot for cars held together by duct tape.

if it really is that easy to fix, it makes more sense for the owner to git er done, and either keep or sell. makes you wonder what else you are going to find.

plus, when it is all done, you still have a car with significant body work.

maybe $2,500 to a body shop owner makes sense. i'm still real curious what happened to the airbags? probably stolen while the car was on the lot someplace."
500,"June 2, 2005 1:06PM",fintail,"i'm curious about the airbags too. i bet if that car could talk, it could tell some stories. i'd run away. something's up."
501,"June 2, 2005 2:45PM",gsemike,"giving the car average miles, that car could be worth $10k at least if fixed, probably even more. the owner doesn't say ""easy fix"". in fact, he says it was estimated at $3,000. let's say he lowballed it and that it would cost $4000 to fix, you're still ahead.

who knows what this guys story is? maybe he doesn't have collision or the cash to fix it. of course you'd have to go over this real good, but i think that the number add up. if you can do the work yourself, this could be a steal."
502,"June 3, 2005 6:48AM",qbrozen,"do we even know if its a 3.5 or 2.5?

$10k for a salvaged altima seems awfully optimistic to me. i could possibly see that price if its a 3.5 se and its fixed up perfect."
503,"June 3, 2005 7:09AM",lemko,...with a salvage title on this altima? a salvage title is the kiss of death if you plan on reselling this car.

505,"June 3, 2005 6:22PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i don't think even $4,000 will fix that car, at least not where i live. air bags are expensive, black is a tough color to match. i wouldn't give more than $2,500 for this car and even then i'd think twice."
506,"June 4, 2005 5:16AM",gsemike,"it's a 2.5 assuming that no one ever swapped out the 17 in alloys for 16s with plastic hubbies. all the 3.5s come with alloys.

maybe because i own an alt, i hold it in higher regard than others. i still see 02 2.5s listed to $10,900 to $11,900."
507,"June 4, 2005 8:58AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well okay, let's back it up from $11k asking price. let's assume that to actually sell it for an $11k asking you'd knock off 10%, for a really nice car. that means it sells for $10k, and you've got a low mileage sharp one owner car with a clean history.

now this guy wants you to pay $5k for a damaged car that obviously hasn't been driven with the greatest of care, and you have to repair some substantial damage. even if you spend $4k and fix everything, was all this trouble and anxiety really worth saving $1,000? and what do you do when you are selling this same car and someone asks ""has it ever been in an accident""? it may even be on carfax and then you are really screwed, because these cars are plentiful. why should someone buy your ""tainted"" car?

so i'm thinkin' this car is worth $2,500 + $4k to fix, giving it a real world re-sale value of around $6,500. fair enough then."
508,"June 6, 2005 1:58PM",ghulet,"....if this is such an 'easy fix' why the owner isn't getting it fixed. perhaps he let the insurance lapse? in any case, i think replacing the airbags and their covers could run $2k alone, then it needs a trunk, rear fender, bumper cover, tail light, paint and who knows what else? i don't see $4k fixing this car properly."
509,"June 9, 2005 6:17AM",andre1969,"but i thought you only got a salvage title if the car got totaled out by the insurance company? also, i think that car might just be a basic model. i can't tell if those are alloys or plastic covers, but the front right wheel is just a cheap stamped steel one. so either a hubcap got broken off (they don't just fall off nowadays), or something happened to that wheel and a cheap steel one had to be put on."
510,"June 9, 2005 8:55AM",Mr_Shiftright,"people have to face the facts about modern cars---when they are hit hard they can be rendered fairly worthless. labor costs and parts prices are so high, and the cars so complex that you can't view them like they were primitive 1965 mustangs. i mean, can you imagine the effort it takes to repair a front end smash-up on a computerized awd car with active suspension, all air bags deployed, etc. ? what are the chances of getting all the electronics to perform again flawlessly?

really, on most modern cars, unless the damage is stricly light sheet metal, you can plan on throwing it away. even if you fix it, nobody wants it, and it has severely diminished value in the marketplace.

example: i have two identical 350zs for sale. one is low miles, no damage, all records, another recently had $12,000 in body damage repaired. how much would i have to discount the damaged one to get you to buy it over the clean undamaged one? i bet at least 30%-50%.

so if fixing them up still makes them worth less, what do you think not fixing them up and trying to sell them, makes them worth?

exactly."
511,"June 9, 2005 4:44PM",ghulet,"i can see something a bit more exotic (like a 350z) taking a bigger hit (dollar wise and on a percentage basis) than something more pedestrian (like a base 4-cylinder altima). most people who want sports cars want them perfect. then again, since altimas are more plentiful, it's a lot easier to be picky. i think if this car is fixed properly (i didn't say perfectly), and the price is right (that is, low compared to other similar vehicles, and given that it will have a salvage title), it shouldn't be too hard to sell to someone who just wants a car to drive into the ground and isn't concerned with resale value. of course, that's a lot of 'ifs'. clearly, a few parties (the repair guy, the owner, the insurance company, at least) ran the numbers and they told them to cut and run, so that should tell you something."
512,"June 9, 2005 4:58PM",fintail,"i know i'd glady pay a premium for an unhit unmessed with car than a fixed wreck. i know there's a good chance the wreck is just fine, but it would always nag at me, it would never be ""right"", and i guarantee i'd find flaws."
513,"June 9, 2005 7:16PM",gsemike,"i think that the salvage title is a good point and will certainly reduce resale value but to call that car a ""wreck"" is probably overboard. i highly doubt that it even has frame damage."
514,"June 9, 2005 7:41PM",fintail,"well, i was speaking about similarly damaged cars in general more than that particular altima...but i would still call it a wreck of sorts. the bags popped and who knows why, if they were stolen i would wonder how much the dash electrics are messed up, and if it was from impact i what the suspension is like, and unless you give it a very good paint job, i bet i'd be able to find the signs in 5 minutes. it would nag me, and unless you planned to drive it to beaterdom, a future buyer would likely find the problems too."
515,"June 10, 2005 5:41AM",andre1969,"about cars like this altima, is even the slightest bump can bend something in the structure. the auto makers don't put nearly as much effort into engineering the rear-ends of the cars as they do the front-ends, when it comes to impact protection, so while the front may crumple in a controlled fashion, the rear may not. body-on-frame construction has gone the way of the dinosaur, and even unitized cars don't have sub-frames as beefy as what they used to have back in the day.

i'd imagine that the underlying structure of that altima has a few bends and ripples in it, as a result of the impact. and it's not that easy to just straighten it back out, because then you'll weaken the structure. if you don't believe me, then go get your grandmother's 1939 world's fair spoon collection and start bending them back and forth, to see what happens! just make sure grandma doesn't have a big, heavy purse to smack you with! :blush:"

517,"June 10, 2005 7:15AM",fintail,"do those cars end up at those high end lots in bad locations?

i'm the type of buyer who gets down on my knees and examines shut lines and panel gaps and paint surfaces and weld lines, etc. of course, the title is the best giveaway."
518,"June 10, 2005 7:21AM",lemko,"...i hope he isn't that crooked. i don't ask him too much about his business. i showed him this picture of a wrecked 1980s rolls-royce and asked if he could restore it. he said, ""sure, no problem! are you interested in this car?"" i don't think i buy a whole 1980s rr let alone a wrecked one."
519,"June 10, 2005 7:25AM",fintail,"a full brake job and major tuneup would approach the value of the car.

i am sure a lot of cars can be fixed and be perfectly roadworthy...but personally, i would always be worried."
520,"June 10, 2005 7:30AM",andre1969,"the manager at the bank we used drove a '79-85 era toronado. i always admired it, and complimented her on it one day. she told me that it was actually a wreck, where they took two car halves and welded them together! now a more trained eye could probably tell, and if i had it to look at nowadays, perhaps i would, too, but back then i sure couldn't tell! considering the toro was body-on-frame though, i think i'd worry about welding two frame halves together!"
521,"June 10, 2005 8:45AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well she probably meant that they put a ""clip"" on the car, the rear sheet metal in one unit.

if they actually cut the frame and welded two frames together, she's totally crazy to drive a car like that---a death wish. i've seen them break in half--i saw a reconstructed older benz do that when it was t-boned.

the problem is not the competence of a really pro body shop...they can make a smashed up car look new again----virtually undetectable if they are really really good. and the car may be safe, and may be reliable, too. the problem is the stigma of damage, and the ""great unknown"" about the future.

as for the guy fixing up smashed luxury cars, the legal problems are enormous, whether he divulges the salvage or not. i hope he has a good attorney."
522,"June 10, 2005 9:26AM",andys120,"insurance companies are conservative about totaling a damaged car. i went into a phone pole sideways in a 5 y/o accord back in '83. the entire left side of the car was caved in and i was sure they'd total it but the approved almost $4k in repairs iirc. it took nearly 4 months to get that car back and no it was never right after that.

i wouldn't touch a totalled car."
523,"June 10, 2005 9:39AM",andre1969,"the threshold that my allstate agent used was 60% of book value. i'm sure it varies among companies, though. they estimated the repair to my '86 monte at around $1500, and valued it at around $2300, which i thought was good for a 12 year old car with 192,000 miles on it! still, i think $1500 was way low. the t-[non-permissible content removed] smashed my front right fender, right door, bent the a-pillar, cracked the windshield, bent the front rim, smashed the hubcap, knocked it out of alignment (god only knows what might have bent in the suspension!) smashed the rocker panel, and also the rear quarter panel. and to top it all off, the car was two-tone, gray-over-silver, which would've made it more expensive to repaint than a monotone."
524,"June 10, 2005 9:49AM",Mr_Shiftright,"there is an ever greater tendency nowadays to total a car out. things have changed with insurance company attitudes. they don't want the liabilities either. we had a very high tide some months ago, and some cars got wet up to the floorboards, and the insurance company just totalled all 35 of them immediately. no question of repairing them.

some insurance companies will not even insure a salvage title car, to the shock of the buyer i must say. caifornia not only stamps the title salvage, but also assigns you a new vin # that is affixed to the car with a metal plate after the car is physically inspected.

all these trends suggest that salvage title cars will become less and less valuable (or saleable) in the future."
525,"June 10, 2005 11:07AM",lemko,"...if you can't even insure a salvage car, it's pretty much worthless unless your reckless and self-destructive enough to drive without insurance. i guess there will be no more ""salvage"" title cars as they will go to the crusher.

what happens if you pull a fairly complete car out of the junkyard and restore it - like say a classic 1955 chevy. will this car have a salvage title even if the car is restored to a level the oem could only dream of?"
526,"June 10, 2005 11:15AM",andre1969,"when i bought my '79 newport, from the junkyard, it had a normal title. they just sold it to me as a used car. i also happened to come across the car on the very day it got brought in though, so it hadn't been dismantled yet. at what point would a car get ""salvage"" on the title? only if it got totaled and the insurance company took possession of it? i do remember, at the local junkyard, for the longest time there was this fairly complete '56 plymouth 4-door sedan that looked restoreable. it had ""no title: parts only"" written on it, meaning that they wouldn't sell you the whole car, i guess."
527,"June 10, 2005 2:27PM",Mr_Shiftright,"it depends. if the salvage yard has a used car license they can just buy and sell the car as a used car. but if the car in question is title-less and has been in the yard for years, it will need new papers and those definitely will get a salvage title.

your state laws will vary. some states are notoriously loose about titles, and that's why if you see a car for sale from alabama or new hampshire, cover your back. titles have been known to get ""cleaned up"", and if shipped interstate, you can do some serious jail time for that."

548,"June 24, 2005 3:05PM",Mr_Shiftright,"junk. waste of time imo. you can buy so much better a starter car for this money, if you want to go cloning.

70 chevelles are not scarce---they only made a mere 354,000 of them...surely there's a better one than this to start with."
549,"June 25, 2005 10:18AM",gsemike,"i'm familiar with that shop that has the porsche. they're right on the way to the 59th st bridge when i head into manhattan. they've got some impressive looking cars when i roll by from 50 feet away at 30 mph. these guys know how to do bodywork, so if they're walking, it must be pretty far gone.

on the chevelle, how many of the 354,ooo are left 35 years later and how many of those are 2 doors? i know someone that paid $7,500 for a very clean car with a later model 350 and auto. the catch that it was a sedan converted into a 2 door by a talented welder. don't discount how much a clone or a solid small block car can go."
550,"June 25, 2005 3:55PM",Mr_Shiftright,"that's the point. they are an extremely plentiful car. there is no 70s chevelle shortage, so you don't need this pile of bolts to build a clone. (and i think someone was pulling your leg about the 2 door/4 door conversion). of course, not all of the 1/3 million chevelles were 2-doors but still there must be easy 25,000 two door cars running around and another 25,000 on cinder blocks. you have to remember that 4-door cars are busted up to save the 2-doors. that's how it works.

i've seen where most of these basket cases end up---from a $2,500 pile of junk to a $7,500 pile of junk."
551,"June 25, 2005 5:11PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i just found auction results for a very decent #3 1970 chevelle that sold at kruse auction in january '05 for $8,500 (deduct 10% auction fees for actual sellling price). so figure $7.650. no way you are going to make that old car look like this one that sold at kruse for an additional $5,000."
552,"June 25, 2005 5:50PM",fintail,"was it a ss though? i figure fees into the price, too. the buyer pays it.

i think it could have been picked up for $2k. it would have been a good backyard project car for a father and son or something. as a very simple car, one could do a lot of work themselves, like powertrain and suspension. figure 3-4k for that and maybe 5-6k for cosmetics (not 100pt quality, just good driver). you'd be in around 10-12kish, and you could get it back easy after enjoying the finished product. of course, the whole thing depends on how rusty it really was. but i was never turning about a quick turnaround.

""you have to remember that 4-door cars are busted up to save the 2-doors. that's how it works""

yep...that's why finding a pristine fintail is like finding a flying pig, but a similar convert or even coupe is 100x easier to come by.

the listing has been deleted btw, so i bet it sold."
553,"June 25, 2005 6:05PM",Mr_Shiftright,"may god have mercy on his soul. i hope they bought it for parts.

i can't get your ""math"" here. i think you are way too optimistic about the cost of building a nice clone to ss specs. you're describing a $25,000 project and hundreds and hundreds of man hours. no a task for the easily daunted, and really, given the nice old chevelles around to build up, it seems totally pointless. i'll bet i could find a running '70 chevelle coupe for $3,000. not pretty, but running.

re: 4-doors....yes, it is one of those odd rules of old cars, that the more common and ""un-special"" the car, the faster the rate of destruction.

you can still see 4-door fintails (i see them all the time here in california) but you hardly never ever see pintos or citations, etc. so that tells me the 4-door fintails, while more numerous than the coupes, still weren't regarded as a totally common, mundane, pedestrian, disposable car. a 4-door chevelle was, however, since they were mostly ""strippers"" and not even malibus."
554,"June 25, 2005 7:31PM",fintail,"the car is already an ss, it just needs a powertrain and restoration. there isn't a spec to really be met. i am also not talking about a concours winer, just a cosmetically good driver. with the market being as overheated as it is for real cars, i think one could not be hurt so much.

i think i see even more plain old w114 240ds and such than pintos or citations...those cars really are gone. i think the badge on the front can help a car survive too...not to mention superior build quality.

i can't recall the last time i saw a 68-72 chevelle sedan in any condition."
555,"June 25, 2005 7:55PM",Mr_Shiftright,"it just hit me what happened with that car!

what might have happened, and i bet it did, is that the car will be junked if it has a valid ss data plate with big block and 4-speed codes, and that plate will be used on a counterfeit car or worse yet, a stolen one. i've seen that more than once.

the ss vin plate is worth the money, not the car."
556,"June 25, 2005 8:30PM",fintail,"you very well could be right. probably a very easy thing to do. move the plate to a fake, part out the real car...make your money back and then some."
557,"June 26, 2005 9:57AM",Mr_Shiftright,"counterfeit and fraud is currently rampant in the muscle car world right now. it's gotten so bad i absolutely refuse to comment on a car's originality anymore. the counterfeiters are very clever...they've reproduced some of the stampings and even the bogus build sheets look pretty good. raised casting #s are harder to fake but i hear someone's tried it with glue-molds or something like that. the casting numbers look real but you can chip them right off.

it could get as weird as it has gotten with rare race cars....once a car hits a million bucks or so, it actually pays to reproduce the entire car exactly--all you really need is a correct engine and some eastern european or italian panel beaters and welders and you're on your way.

i suppose someday we'll have the equivalent of dna testing for muscle cars!"
558,"June 30, 2005 4:10PM",xwesx,"""i think i see more.... than pintos or citations... those cars really are gone.""

i have a 1974 pinto wagon. unfortunately, the original i4 threw a rod and cracked the block back in '99, so it doesn't run at this point, but i'll get it back on the road eventually. it is actually in darned good condition for being a worthless old car (no rust, only a couple very minor tears in upholstery, no body damage, etc). if only i had the time to work on it - it could be a driveable worthless old car!"

looks like the best part of this car is maybe the body shell if it isn't too heavily bondo'd up...might be able to make some kind of pro-street out of it or retro-rod, though personally i'd start out with something better.

car is too screwed up and not worth the cost of restoration imo. you can buy a decent clean all-original driver for around $15,000 (remember this is a two-door post sedan, not a ht) and a near-show car for $25k. can you make this one a show car for $19,000? no way.

579,"July 5, 2005 7:14AM",qbrozen,"geez. if all that's true, my initial assessment on this one was way off. i was thinking ""hmmm... boyd coddington could turn that into a street rod and it will fetch $50k."""

583,"July 5, 2005 9:25AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah but if you say that you'll get the old ""but working on a car project is so good for you"" argument, which more often than not, is just a way to justify getting in over your head in the first place. doing appraisal work as i do sometimes, i have to deal with not being shot as the messenger when i tell an owner in dollar amounts that restoring that 6 cylinder dodge dart really wasn't a good idea. at the onset of a project, they are saying ""oh, i know it's not a classic"" or ""i'm not doing this for money"" but then alas they add up all the receipts and suddenly the full impact of how much time and money they've lost hits them.

been there, done that."

and what's with the 2 engines? are they both in the jeep now? it follows that ""front drive and rear end"" statement, so maybe its got one engine driving the front wheels and one for the back. lol. (yeah, yeah, i know, it doesn't, but that's almost what it sounds like in the description.) are either of the engines in the truck? and do either of them work??

anyway, although i love jeeps, there is no way i would touch that as a project car."
587,"July 5, 2005 3:31PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i think he means both differentials are still in the vehicle.

well, then we couldn't figure out how to put it on, so he had to pay someone about 60 bucks for that. and then, a few months later, got a new car urge and traded the thing in at carmax for an '04 crown vic. he got a whopping $600 in trade.

i didn't even think of going the ebay route. my intrepid's headlights are getting really cloudy, so maybe i'll try to snag some off ebay, instead of going to the dealer for some new ones. or just trade it on a new charger! :shades:"

this is priced like a runner but appears to be a project. never a good sign when the front and back are different colors. i am also pretty sure these had an airbag...but this one does not have the right steering wheel. bad sign"
600,"July 15, 2005 8:30AM",andre1969,"but i like that '58 desoto firesweep. i like the way the way the seller tries to build it up by saying that it has the same 350 that christine had. umm, yeah, they were both mopar 350 wedges, but christine's unit was a high-output with dual quads. the desoto firesweep came standard with a 350-2bbl, and a 4-bbl was optional. hp was either 280 or 295, depending on the carb. oddly though, the fury's golden commando only put it up to 305 hp, although i'm sure it was still a much better performer.

but saying they're the same engine is like saying that the old 350-2bbl that my grandparents '72 impala had in it is the same engine that a '96 impala ss has! i came close to buying a car like that firesweep back in '95. it was white with a yellow top and spear, and in better shape than that one. i could've gotten it for $900-950, and would have, but someone else had first dibs on it.

as for that impala ss, it would probably depend on what engine it had in it. i'm too lazy to decode that vin, but i'd guess that if it was an ss409 it would probably be worth it, but if it was a lesser model, you're looking at a real labor of love there!"
601,"July 15, 2005 8:41AM",andre1969,"to decode that '63 impala. it wasn't that hard...

the first digit, 3, is the model year, 1963 in this case
the 2nd and third digits are the series. 18 = impala v-8 (no distinction for ss in the vin, and also no distinction on engine size, just v-8 versus 6-cyl)
the 4th and 5th digits are the body style. 67 = 2-door convertible
the 6th digit is the assembly plant. b = baltimore.
the last six digits are the sequence number. it was the 125571st car to come down the assembly line that year.

i guess there might be some other tag somewhere that might denote what engine it had, but it doesn't appear it can be deciphered from the vin #, like newer cars can."
602,"July 15, 2005 9:00AM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh, so i'm the bad guy, hah? okay, here goes:

1983 porsche 928 found in a backyard -- you know, if the bid stays at about $2,500, this might make a great parts car. restoration would be somewhat foolish, since you can just go out and buy a nice '83 for around $6,000, ready to go. but actually putting money in this car would be pretty stupid. if the tranny is good, that's worth something, and all those expensive parts in there are valuable--some of them actually made of un-obtanium. car is fully priced at $2,500, maybe overpriced. i suppose you could try and drive it around, but i'd bet you a very expensive lunch you wouldn't last two weeks. these are very complex cars that do not take kindly to being submerged in someone's back yard.

1971 trans am -- rust bucket, undesirable year/model, busted block...yeah right.....the scrapyard is where it needs to go. you can buy this car clean running with tunes playing on the radio for $9,000, so what is the point of resurrecting this......thing.....? would make a nice reef for fish.

1963 impala ss --- again, the boneyard for this one. do the math---you can buy this car, numbers matching show condition for $30,000. this car, with bent frame, rust and missing engine and transmission, will never attain status as a ""real"" ss anyway. i have a feeling the vin plates on this car is what is being bid on. if it were a hemi cuda, yeah sure, do the job because you are looking at a very valuable car on the other end, but this could only be a semi-clone at best.

1958 desoto -- no harm done at the bid of $2,150. not worth much even fixed up and pretty, so i'd cap the total investment at around $5,000. if you earl scheib it and do some other cosmetics, you'd be okay on this car and you can have fun with it. so far, not a bad buy and worth fixing if you stay sober.

1989 porsche 928 s4 -- looks like a fabulous car, but too bad it's an automatic. by 1987, they had solved all the clutch problems so this car would be twice as sweet with a 5-speed. i think he'd get his price with a manual trans. but his asking is going to be tough. if someone came by with $18,000 in a suitcase, he should take it.

mercedes 2.3 --- awful cars, run like hell at any price. :lemon:"
603,"July 15, 2005 9:22AM",gsemike,"ok... so when was the last time you saw a car and thought, ""man.... that's really a good deal""?"
604,"July 15, 2005 9:39AM",fintail,"funny thing...rumor on craigslist was that the owner of that red 928 purchased it not long ago for 18k and is now trying to make a quick buck. i wouldn't mind that car, but i am sure maintenance on it makes a mb look like a civic.

i think i got relatively good deals on my fintail and 126. i'm not in a hole, anyway."
605,"July 15, 2005 9:39AM",andre1969,"last saturday i came dangerously close to buying another car. i was at the mopar nationals in carlisle, and someone was selling a 1979 dodge st. regis. now most people probably don't know what that is to begin with, and of those that do, most probably don't care. but for some twisted reason, i've always loved the '79-81 r-bodies.

anyway, i forget how many miles it had on it, but it only had one bad rust spot, around the rear wheel opening (most of the rear wheel opening, in fact). it was light blue, somewhat faded but i've had worse, and a dark blue vinyl top. the interior was cloth with a 60/40 split bench seat, and was in fairly nice shape. it had a 360 2-bbl, which, while that probably doesn't add much value, definitely makes these cars less slug-like. most of them only had 318-2bbls which were barely adequate. and the headlight covers were open, as the mechanism that operates them was broken. i heard someone say that the bar that twists them was taken out, but i'm sure it had more problems than that! my biggest concern was that it had a trailer hitch on it, so i wonder what kind of abuse it might have gone through. still, i could've had it for $500.

if i really needed a car, i would've snatched it up in a heartbeat. but when you don't need another car, $500 is money that can really be spent elsewhere. plus, you have to tag/title it, and insure it. and fix it when it breaks. and one problem with a spare car is that when it does break, there's no pressing need to get it fixed right away, so it's easy to just let it sit and get neglected.

so, in the long run, it's probably best that i didn't buy the thing."
606,"July 15, 2005 9:40AM",andre1969,"would that also hold true for, say, a 1963 impala ss409 convertible? one of those would only fetch around $30,000 on the top end?"
607,"July 15, 2005 1:13PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i have the new ""excellence"" magazine which has the latest market report on the 928 from around the world, delivered by a recognized porsche expert, and he pegs an s4 fully priced in excellent condition at $17,000. that's what it's worth. if some fool on craigslist wants to pay more, that still doesn't make that the ""market"", that only means one person paid too much.

last ""good deal"" i found?

my 928! bright shiny red 1980 5-speed, excellent cosmetics and mechanicals, $25,000 in restoration work last 5 years, needed nothing....$4,500 out the door.

now a year later i'm in a total of $6,000 and that's about what i could get for it. so i'm clean, and got 10,000 fun miles.

that's the way you want to buy 'em and sell 'em imho. :p"
608,"July 15, 2005 1:19PM",Mr_Shiftright,"no, a real ss 409 would cost you maybe $38k-45 if it was automatic and probably bust $50k if it was a 4-speed. we are talking nice cars though, not #3 street cars with amateurish work that looks good from 10 feet.

i suppose a totally correct 409/425hp ss convertible show quality could bust $60,000.

being an automatic is a definite deduct though, and an ss with 283 v8 isn't going to bring 327 or 409 money, so forget that.

so you see what a hose job that ebay car is.

people don't pay barett-jackson money for second-rate cars with wrong engines and welded floorpans and crooked frames. someone will buy the car, definitely, but if you did a quality restoration, you'd never come out whole on a ""[non-permissible content removed]"" car like that one.

i've seen ""clone"" muscle cars sell for a lot of money, but they are drop dead gorgeous and they have all the correct parts retro-actively installed."
609,"July 18, 2005 12:08PM",qbrozen,"i first saw this:
http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/alfa-romeo-milano-3-liter-verde-3-0_w0qqitemz4562629394qqca- - tegoryz5356qqrdz1qqcmdzviewitem

and thought, 3.0 milanos are fairly rare (aren't they? seem to remember it being so when i was shopping around for a 2nd alfa a few years ago). and maybe, just maybe, if cheap enough, this could be a fun car. but it does need more work than its worth, i think.

then i spotted this one:
http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/1988-alfa-romeo-milano-verde-garaged-not-bmw-spider_w0qqite- - mz4562256855qqcategoryz5356qqrdz1qqcmdzviewitem

and thought, ok, now we're talking. how high do you think this will go with almost 6 days left? i mean, who knows what may be lurking behind a real inspection (or at least some better pictures), but if its really all there and really as nice as it seems at first glance, what is a car like this really worth?

any bets on final bid price? i'm thinking $4500 ... but you never know what will happen when you get multiple alfa fans together in one bidding war."
610,"July 18, 2005 12:52PM",stickguy,"i like the second one. sounds like a much better bet, since it might cost more to bring the beater up to the condition of the nice one than it would to just buy the nice one instead.

makes me suspicious when someone parks a perfectly fine running car just becasue the clutch went out."
611,"July 18, 2005 1:18PM",lemmer,"i agree with stickguy, although i am a little suspicious of post number of the beast."
612,"July 18, 2005 4:02PM",Mr_Shiftright,"a clean ready to go milano verde is worth about $3,750 more or less. they are neither ""rare"" nor valuable and never will be, but for the money it's a fun car.

the ""beater"" for $699 is a parts car. clutch and brake work of that nature would exceed the value of the car probably. it's not an easy job.

only one way to buy a milano---buy it mint and buy it cheap and have a good alfa shop to keep it up for you. if you can stay on top of the car it should serve you pretty well.

i wouldn't go so far as to say that you could totally rely on it for a daily commuter however.

the alfa spiders are an older and more proven design."
613,"July 18, 2005 6:50PM",gsemike,"guys,

this isn't really a project car, but since i respect you collective opiniosn, what do you think of this for a second car:

red beemer

i'm moving to the burbs and will need a second car for my mile drive to the train. would a 1994-5 3 series in the 100k neighborhood be a good choice? what are the things to look out for? can i count on an unmolested example serving me reliably?

thanks"
614,"July 18, 2005 8:22PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well after shoveling through the incredible horse...pucky that decorated this ad, i did manage to uncover beneath the silly talk a fairly nice little car.

1995 is a good year for 3 series. at 100k you need to watch out for, or ask about:

was the radiator ever replaced (it usually bursts open around 50-60k)

inspect the upper control arm bushings

test every electrical gizmo and be sure to check the dash illumination at night.

make sure you really fit in this car....it's very tight if you are over about 5'10"" or 160 lbs or so.

the selling price was just a bit over private party retail so no harm done."
615,"July 19, 2005 6:56AM",qbrozen,"there is no way i could see my way clear of spending $6400 on a 10-year-old, 100k miler automatic 325. i mean, i spent ~$3500 on a super clean 100k mile '93 benz 190e with the straight 6 just last year. so, to me, almost double the price for maybe, arguably, 10-20% more car is not a good deal by any means.

personally, i'd be looking at a turbo volvo of similar vintage for far less money. or, heck, a much younger car of just about any other make. i think the price on this bimmer makes that milano i posted look like a bargain. but, yes, i am crazy in many regards."

928---nice car looks like. being owned by a former football star is worth about $1.50 in resale value. the car is what it is and should sell for whatever market is on these...maybe...$8k-10k.

'65 mustang --- bid at $800 is plenty already, an act of generosity. you can buy a clean 6 cylinder car for $6,000 so why bother with this wreck? if it were a v-8 convertible it'd be worth the asking price because you can restore it and sell it for $25,000 and only lose $10,000."

true story: i once found a fiat x1/9 abandoned (during a snowstorm in colorado). left there by the side of the road. nice shape, too. person never came back (died after wandering off??). so, took the car and garaged it. called cops. called dmv. placed ""found"" ads, put up flyers right at spot car was left.....nothing. finally, after another 6 months, i just sent a check to alabama and had a bona fide title in 3 weeks. registered it to colorado dmv and got colorado title, no problem. drove it for some time as a fun sunny day car.

and i could have done this with a very expensive car under salvage title, too.

not sure if all these loopholes have been closed, but....buyer beware!"
639,"July 22, 2005 7:07AM",andre1969,"yesterday somebody put a note in my mailbox saying ""i'm interested in buying your white dodge"" (meaning my '68 dart). i've always fantasized about fixing it up, but truthfully, it's at the point where i could probably go and buy one in good shape for much cheaper than it would be to get this one fixed up real nice.

anyway, here's the stats on it...1968 dodge dart 270 hardtop coupe. originally a 273-2bbl/torqueflite. now has a rebuilt v-8, but i don't know if it's a 318 or 273. the guy i bought it from told me it was a 318, but i don't know. it definitely has some kick to it, so i'm inclined to think it's a 318. but it was built up a bit, so it could just as well be a 273 that was hopped up. after all, a dart isn't a particularly heavy car.

the rear quarter panels are rusty, and both front fenders have light body damage. it has a/c, and the compressor works, but the control for the inside-cabin fan is shorted out. somewhere along the line before i owned it, someone put an aftermarket flip-up sunroof in it. the door panels are out of a '69 dart gt, and the seats are out of an early 70's duster/demon/dart sport. i do have a set of gt buckets though, and the gt rear seat.

the real kicker though, is that the car has 338,000 miles on it (engine rebuilt around 241,000, and tranny replaced with with a used, but rebuilt at some point in its life unit around the same time). i put an 8 3/4 rear in it back in '97, somewhere around the 330k+ mile mark. i have no idea how many miles it had on it, though. oh, and it won't run. i think the fuel pump needs to be replaced.

if i ever got serious about selling it, i'd try to at least get it running again, but with this guy showing an interest in it, that might not be that critical at this point. about a month or so ago, one of my neighbors told me that he had a friend that might be interested in it to turn into a racecar, so he wouldn't care about the engine, anyway. and while it does have the quarter panel rust, structurally it's still good, with a solid k-frame, front and rear sub-frames, and where they attach to the body, etc. so, any ideas as to what i should ask for it, when i call this guy up? i was thinking maybe $900-1000?

i'll try to post some pics of it later tonite. also, as a disclaimer, i'm just trying to ask for advice here, and not trying to sell it on edmund's. if i've crossed the line though, i apologize, and i'll either pull this post down, or one of the hosts will! :p"
640,"July 22, 2005 9:34AM",stickguy,"i would say as is, where is, ask $1,000. too much less and you might as well keep it for sentimental value, or in case you ever feel like working on it yourself.

of course, he may lose interest when he finds out ift doesn't run, so replacing the fuel pump might be a good idea, so you can at least get it to turn over.

then, post a picture here so we can all run it into the ground"

642,"July 22, 2005 10:38AM",Mr_Shiftright,"you can read the engine # just below the left cylinder head (right side as you face the engine) just below the valve cover if you wipe off the block you can see numbers and it should say ""318"" + other numbers. these numbers face the front of the car.

i don't think it really matters if it's a 273 or 318 regarding value however."
643,"July 22, 2005 10:48AM",Mr_Shiftright,"pretty funny --- yeah, it's ""rare"" all right because nobody wants one.

78-79 is a baaaaaad year for a 928, worst possible choice. in 1980 they squared away a lot of problems and in 1987 they really got the car ""right"".

it would be a good parts car--you'd be kinda nuts to put any more effort into this one.

and why would someone put in a new clutch in a 928 (no easy job!!) and have a bad throw out bearing... very weird...

another thing you can do...there's a company that makes a chevy v-8 conversion kit for the car. so you can build a street rod out of it if you want."
644,"July 22, 2005 10:50AM",andre1969,"i was pretty sure that the numbers were stamped on it somewhere, but just didn't know where to look. so they're on the head then, and not the block?! what did they do then, when some engines used heads from others? for instance, i heard that the mopar copcar 318 used the heads from a 360.

regardless of value though, i'm curious to find out, now! i might try to find out tonite...if the wasps don't get me when i'm messing around under the hood! :p"
645,"July 22, 2005 1:15PM",andre1969,"shifty, i went back and re-read your message. don't ask me how mis-read it to say that the number was on the head and not the block! i must be going scenic! :shades:"
646,"July 22, 2005 1:29PM",Mr_Shiftright,"or simpler yet---

the 5th digit of your vin identifies the engine

273 is a ""d""
318 is an ""f""

yeah, on the block, facing forward, just below where the head meets the block. wait a sec i'll get you the #s.....

it should read

pm or pt
then....
273 or 318
then
4-digit julian date code
then
4-digit julian sequential production #

so an example would be:

pm38321872401

that's a 383 built in the mound road engine plant. ""pt"" is trenton."
647,"July 22, 2005 2:01PM",andre1969,"is a ""d"", for 273 v-8 (lh23db8xxxxxx or something like that). only thing is, the original engine was pulled at around 242,000 miles. the seller told me that it had a rebuilt 318 with 11,000 miles on it when i bought it. he said that it had been running fine, but he wanted more power, so he put all this work into it and hopped it up a bit. only thing is, i don't know if he had the original 273 rebuilt (or who knows? it's conceivable the original 273 blew up before he bought it and a 318 got put in, and then he rebuilt it?) or if he found a 318, rebuilt it, and put it in?

oh yeah, i just went in under the hood and tried to clean it off. it's a very tight squeeze between the power steering pump and the front of the engine, so i got a little reminder there of why i never tried that hard to look for the engine # before! i tried to clean as best i could in there, but couldn't find anything. i wasn't able to clean very far down below the head, though, as it's such a tight squeeze.

so, i guess this thing will go to the grave, without me ever knowing which smallblock it really had. oh well, i'll live! when i was out there, i took a really good look at the thing, too. i think i'm starting to accept the fact that there's no way i'm ever going to fix it up. and i don't want to turn into one of those people that holds onto a piece of junk forever, with aspirations of fixing it up, when year after year it just gets worse. if someone else is really interested in it, maybe it's time to pass the torch!

the sad thing is, if i got it running (presuming it's just the fuel pump) and took it up to carlisle, if i were to price it comparable to some of the other junk up there, i'd have to put an asking price of around $4,000 on it! :p i often wonder how much some of that overpriced junk really goes for, though. and, of course, i see plenty of cars come back, year after year, after not being sold. and often with a higher price tag than before! you'd think that after awhile, insurance and tags and such would eat up the value of some of these cars, and really make it hard to recoup. in my case, the dart only costs around $25 per year to insure and another $25 to keep tagged, so i don't even notice it. i guess some of these people, likewise, might have antique tags and insurance, which keeps their costs low too, though."
648,"July 22, 2005 2:11PM",andre1969,"correction, i went out again and looked, and sure enough there are some numbers there. only problem is, at some point this block was painted, a little extra thick, so they're really faint and hard to read.

i finally found the digital camera, and the usb cable, so i took a few pics of the poor beast. enjoy, guys! :p

the wasps are getting a little stirred up now, too, so maybe i'd better leave the car alone for a bit :shades:"
649,"July 22, 2005 2:15PM",Mr_Shiftright,"spray some brake-cleen on it, that should take enough paint off...or wire brush it.

sometimes you can take a mirror and a flashlight and that helps...the numbers will read backwards but you can still make them out.

i go through this all the time. i have a magnifier that lights up."

652,"July 27, 2005 7:34PM",ghulet,".....i can't see any upside to that thing, not even as a parts car. hmmm, not a great production year to begin with, floorboards clearly rusting through, no terribly valuable interior parts, engine is likely shot ('it may run' is a lot like saying 'i may win the lotto if i try', and about as likely), and there are virtually no usable original body parts. buh-bye. $6500 or whatever that thing is bid up to right now is an absolute pipe dream."
653,"July 27, 2005 7:36PM",Mr_Shiftright,i think the bids are phoney. the whole think stinks.
654,"July 28, 2005 9:01AM",ghulet,"as miatas are fairly 'simple' cars, i don't think this is too far gone, and the price is tempting. i have the feeling those pictures are not of the actual car, though.

oh, fintail!!! i suspect this is 'too far gone' (at least in terms of money you'd have to put in versus money you'd get back out!), despite the owner's assertions to the contrary. could be a decent parts car for the price, though:

655,"July 28, 2005 9:12AM",andre1969,"at least it looks like the body's still solid on that fintail. if my dart's body was in that kind of shape, i wouldn't be considering cutting it from the herd right now. oops, that reminds me, i have to call that dude back! i did call him and left a message, but then he called me back and left a message, so i haven't spoken directly.

i did tell him though, that it has about 338,000 miles on it, engine was rebuilt about 100,000 miles ago, and that it's not currently running, that i think it's the fuel pump. considering he called me back, i'm guessing i haven't scared him off yet! if this falls through though, it's going on craigslist. i'll probably bring it up in my mopar mailing list, too."
656,"July 28, 2005 9:30AM",lemmer,"you can get a really decent miata for $3,500, which is probably less than the needed body and paint work on that car."

658,"July 28, 2005 9:35AM",fintail,"yeah, that fintail is too far gone to be a serious project, unless you love the cars and don't count your labor time into the costs of renovation. really nice cars that need nothing serious, like mine, are only worth about 5k...and you couldn't get that car to be like mine for 5k.

the ac unit is worth the price, though. good parts car. a 220 may be rare, but that's because it was the stripper 6cyl w111, single carb. the owner is not correct in saying a 220se is ""far more common""...production numbers differed on the 220/220se by only a few thousand units. the 220s is the common model. i see really no serious rust on it, the car looks to have been stored inside at one time (fintails were not rustproofed very well, and disintegrate in harsh climates). you could do worse, for a parts car."

664,"July 28, 2005 11:28AM",stickguy,"unless it is comepletely mis-represented, seems like a heck of a good deal. of course, if they spry painted over the rust, i might take that back.

only thing better would be if it was a convertible. those are neat."

ok, yes, i admit, i'm being a wiseheimer. ;b

i just see this as one of those cars that, if its really that clean, and if all those repairs were done recently and correctly, its not at all easy to compare it to the other rx7s out there. could i find another $2k rx7? sure. would it have a recently rebuild drivetrain and recently redone seats, etc? most likely not.

i know you and i have discussed all of this before and we don't see eye to eye on it. but ... oh well. i like that purchase and you don't. no big deal."
667,"July 28, 2005 1:50PM",Mr_Shiftright,"nah, nah- i didn't say ""i didn't like it"" ....never said that....only wanted to point out that it isn't ""a bargain""....it's a fair price for buyer and fair price for seller. that's what market correct means. everybody happy.

besides, ac might be blown and that could cost $$.

these cars are worth very little and are very plentiful. yes! i'd take a bet i could find you a $2,500 rx-7 that is newer, cleaner, and with working ac.

what we can't factor into the price is search time, but you can't add search time to book values.

but if you bought this one for $2,000, no harm done, presuming somebody put the engine together correctly.

so i'm really on your side on this one, more or less :p"
668,"July 28, 2005 7:40PM",ghulet,"....i've rarely had a working a/c without putting lots of money into it on a ten year-old car (hell, on half the five year-old cars i've dealt with), let alone a twenty year-old car, i hardly think it's even an issue, especially at $2k. with the weather we've had this year (non-stop 90s most of july, even in chicago), i don't think i'd risk using the a/c on a car that old even if i were fairly confident it were functioning properly; too many other risks (overheating, head gaskets, blah blah blah). it's still a luxury to me, unfortunately! i also think it'd just look geeky to be driving around in an old basic rx7, windows up with the air on like some auto-diva."
669,"July 28, 2005 7:49PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i mostly use ac to keep the traffic noise and the stink out, but you're right, ac can put strain on an old engine. still it does increase/decrease the car's value since there are plenty people who want it."
670,"July 29, 2005 6:25AM",lemmer,"shifty,

pca has in its classifieds a white 356b with an engine scattered throughout a garage for $7500 in birmingham, al (oddly enough, that is where i live). it looks really solid in the pictures the guy sent, but i am sure it needs plenty of work. my father-in-law can get parts at cost and can do a lot of the work himself at a friend's porsche shop. he wants to make just a decent weekend driver out of it. is it worth it?

the rest of the peanut gallery should feel free to give their two cents, also."
671,"July 29, 2005 7:03AM",stickguy,"if it is complete, and the bones are sound, a 356 should be a failrly straightforward assembly job, right? at least compared to a ferrari or something!

if so, the price looks something like i would expect. the quality and quantity of the engine parts is also improtant of course.

the key to making this deal work for you is your fil. free labor is hard to pass up.

i usually fall on the side of buying the nice one that is already done, since it is usually cheaper than bringing a dog up to par, but in your case, that might not be true."
672,"July 29, 2005 8:54AM",Mr_Shiftright,"might be worth it depending on the integrity of the body and how correct the car is otherwise.

the body is extremely important on these cars as they have no frame per se. the body is the frame. sooooooo, if the rust is bad enough and in the wrong places (like where the a pillar meets the floor, you can just throw the car away. it'll never be made right. never, ever. junk. finito.

but if the body is solid, or maybe just has a pinhole or two in the front trunk floor or passenger floorboards, that's not too bad. you can just patch that.

as for correctness, first of all you'd better check that there isn't a 912 engine in there, which is common. that's okay, since a 356 engine is basically the same, but the car will still be a ""[non-permissible content removed]"" with an incorrect engine. actually a 912 engine would be better than the stock engine in mechanical terms but not authenticity.

now one issue is that these engines are not easy to do correctly. if you have pro help that's great. i presume the shop knows enough not to buy cheap japanese pistons and liners, or a ""big bore"" kit. these are tempting because they are so much cheaper than the german parts. but they are also not quite right. they raise the compression and your engine goes kaboom. even with the correct german parts, the rebuilder has to do the mathematics and actually measure the cylinder capacity with liquid measurements, vis a vis the head and head gaskets, so that the correct compression ratio is achieved. if you say flycut the heads and just slap them on there with a stock head gasket, you may have made a fatal mistake by having an engine with too high a compression ratio. you'll pre-ignite and chunk out a piston on the first long hill, sure as shootin'.

then, too, you have to consider replacing the clutch, surface the flywheel, and rebuilding the carbs ( a nuisance when old) and the generator. it would be a shame to throw old parts on a new engine. and you'll need a new engine seal and maybe new heater boxes.

basically what i'm saying is that even with free labor, you may end up with a break even situation in terms of value (meaning you could just go buy one for the same money by the time you add up all your bills) but the one you buy probably won't have all new parts.

figure a clean b coupe (the c coupes are worth more), #3 driver with a few minor chips and tatters, is worth $15,000. so if yours isn't dented or rusted and drives nice, you have $7,500 to play with. if the car is in anyway shabby, figure $12,000 total value or less.

for perspective, i just saw yesterday a very clean (no dings, dents, shiny paint, spotless interior but not a show car---a high #3, low #2) 356c coupe (with disc brakes) with a good california history, asking price $19,000.

what would i do? personally, i'd look for a good used 912 engine ready to run, and put that in (cost you about $2,500) and then maybe rebuild the other engine over time---then plug in the original and re-sell the 912 engine.

here in california, a good shop charges $10,000 for a thorough rebuild of a 356 engine. so really, if the car is pretty clean, to my mind it's not worth more than say $5,000 as is."
673,"July 29, 2005 11:22AM",lemmer,"thanks for the free info, but you are too cheap. if i would written a client a letter with that much valuable information, i would have billed them at least $100. maybe $200. a lawyer would likely double that.

my father-in-law is a retired fedex engineer who does two three things for retirement. he visits my grandchildren, races his 912, and works for free for a friend who builds 356 and 911 race and street cars (he doesn't really work completely for free, he gets parts at cost and help with his car)."
674,"July 29, 2005 12:08PM",Mr_Shiftright,"actually my bill is in the mail.... :p

well it sounds like pop in law knows his way around the block. i always try to make people look soberly at rebuilding a porsche engine because some of them are saying ""well, i've rebuilt vw engines, same thing right?""

nooooooo......if you built it to the specs of a vw engine it would never run right, if at all.

part of your decision would be based i think on whether the crankshaft in the engine is any good or not. once you have to get a new crank and do a line bore plus all the usual machine work, you are farming out a lot and hence the bills add up.

notice how this piston set below is of the correct alloy, german made and not flat-topped. that's why they cost so much more than japanese kaboom piston sets. if you pull flat tops out of the old engine, you know why it grendaded. porsche engines are very tough and long-lived and should not normally ever blow up under street conditions.

675,"July 29, 2005 2:30PM",andre1969,"that guy that was interested in my dart came by today and looked at it. he actually seems interested, but he had two buddies with him. one of them was telling him that the car had a lot of potential, in spite of its problems, but told him that he had a lot of work cut out for him. the other was trying to find everything under the sun wrong with it, and said ""would you take $200?""

so needless to say, it's still sitting. i figure that, in spite of its problems, i could easily part it out and get a lot more than $200! heck, even the 8 3/4 rear end is probably worth more than that!

i tried to start it up, and it sounds like it turns over real strong still, but even dumping gas down the carb i couldn't get it to fire up. anyway, i figure if this falls through, then craigslist it is!"

well now you can buy a clean ready to run ""driver"", #3 condition and/or amateur--street type restoration for around $12,000, so do the math. sounds like a loser to me unless it were an ss 409. perhaps, perhaps....you could turn it into an ss clone but even there theh prospects of coming out even or better are pretty slim

i'd say if it were a real and provable ss data plate car, then maybe, otherwise, i wouldn't give more than $1,500-$2,000 for this tired beater, and then i'd probably rod it for sure.

681,"July 31, 2005 11:56AM",bumpy,"the wraparound windshield is worth $600 by itself. that gmc hood is hard to find intact. the rest of the truck is in decent shape, certainly better than a parts truck, and it has the hard-to-find stuff. that v6 is hard to kill; i bet it would fire right up with a basic tuneup and a new battery."
682,"July 31, 2005 7:34PM",Mr_Shiftright,"bumpy excuse me if i engage in friendly debate on this :p

if the windshield is like the rest of the truck it's going to look like sandpaper. and what's ""hard to find"" exactly""? i don't see a piece of trim worth .50 cents, and you can buy all the hard parts you need 'cept maybe the fenders or other sheet metal, and given the labor you'll have to expend to straighten those out and get 'em right, i don't think $300 is unreasonable for parts.

remember this isn't a wrecking yard, that is dismantling, cleaning, storing, labeling and guaranteeing the parts, so you can't be looking at the pieces as all retail parts on a shelf ready to go. each fender could be 12 rusted bolts and 6-10 hours bodywork for all we know.

as for the engine, you could be right or i could be right but the question is, who is more likely to be right given what we are looking at here? besides, the owner had 34 years to kill that engine.

all i see here is outright neglect and a chicken-house with rubber tires.

if i saw a current reg on it and it started up and drove, no matter how badly, perhaps i'd up the price a bit, but as is where is, dead as a doornail, why gamble with your own money?"

that is, if it does start up without too much trouble (and i guess even if it turns over, that's a good sign), and as long as whatever rust there is doesn't look like it compromises the cab/frame too badly. i can't get the link to work today though, so i can't look at the pics to refresh my memory.

how much would a decent bed cost for that thing?"
685,"August 1, 2005 11:50AM",Mr_Shiftright,"$3,000 (so far on the bid) is a bit low. these early 944s aren't worth much and you should be able to get a nice one at $4,500-$6,000 all day long. let's see if it falls in that range. he's blowing smoke on the top speed, though. he'd be lucky to hit 125-130 mph on a windless day in the vacuum of outer space.

on the plus side, 944s are great handling cars and if properly set up, can handle and brake as well as just about any stock 2005 car you can name short of $$ supercars."
686,"August 1, 2005 12:21PM",ghulet,"....147mph was the exact quoted top speed from porsche brochures of the day (86-87) for the 944 turbo. funny how the turbo's stats always manage to end up in a trumped-up ad for a na 944 (usually an automatic at that!). i'm pretty sure quoted top speed of even later '80s 944s is 130, which to me is even a bit optimistic (we're talking about a car with 147hp here; oh wait, maybe that's where that 147 mph top speed figure came from!)."
687,"August 1, 2005 12:27PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i'd guess that realistically, the maximum flat out speed on that '84 944 with lots of room would be, measured by radar, no more than about 121-123 mph. one would hope the new owner has the talent to go even that fast.

perhaps the seller has evoked the 20-20-20% rule of car ads.

you are allowed to lie up to 20hp and 20 mph top speed and 20% more gas mileage."
688,"August 1, 2005 1:11PM",lemmer,"from my old r&t issues, i saw 8v 944 non-turbos recorded at 121 to 131 over the years, so you guys are right on.

obviously i wouldn't be buying it based on flat out speed. in fact, i fear my wife's minivan would outrun it."
689,"August 1, 2005 6:16PM",ghulet,"....but as shiftright stated, they handle wonderfully, can even be a practical daily driver as long as you don't find a needy example (clutches are expensive, and i know from family experience/allegory that a/c compressors or condensers are about $2k installed, if you feel you need air). they're reasonably comfortable, slightly practical (not for passengers, but as a hatchback, i used to load my mom's recycle in hers), nice looking, well built and get decent gas mileage. how's that for damning with faint praise? just don't spend more than about $5k on one, keep up on maintenance but don't get crazy with repairs or trying to make one 'perfect' (there's no upside to having a trailer queen here) and you could be ok. just don't expect it to go up in value any time too soon, if ever. that said, they're at the point where they aren't depreciating much (not as much as your average used cars, as they're mostly ~20 years old), either."
690,"August 1, 2005 7:20PM",Mr_Shiftright,"exactly...badly ""busted"" 944s are strictly parts car. a slipping clutch and bad ac compressor and one small dent is about a total on the car, sad to say.

the 944 turbo is the one you want. you can build them up over 300 hp and run with the wolves."
691,"August 2, 2005 6:25AM",lemmer,"ok, i'll bite.

if a nice 944 is around $5000, how much for a nice 944 turbo?

i am the current high bidder on the 944 in question at $3350, but i bet his reserve is way higher. what condition is a car like this 1-5?"
692,"August 2, 2005 3:51PM",Mr_Shiftright,"nice 944 turbo or turbo s probably $9,000--$12,000.

944 s2 cabriolet (nice car) maybe $14k-$20k

the car being bid on, probably $4,000---$6,500.

definitely a plain jane 944 early model, it's at the bottom of the pecking order/desirability.

what part of the country are you in?"
693,"August 3, 2005 6:51AM",lemmer,"i am still in birmingham, al - home of the clean title.

the car is in orlando, but i have family there that can get it checked out and trailered up to me for free.

i really like 944 turbos, but for $9-12k couldn't i maybe squeeze into a 911 sc? and wouldn't you say that maintenance would be less on the sc? wouldn't the sc likely hold its value better?"
694,"August 3, 2005 9:15AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah, you could just squeeze into a really solid 911sc for $12k, and yes, it will hold value better than a ""base"" 944.

but the 944s are starting to creep up there (finally).

i don't know if sc maintenance is cheaper, but you'll do less of it than on a 944, so i guess in that sense, yes, it's cheaper.

if you start with a top flight 911, probably throwing $400 in the spring and $400 in the fall should take care of basic maintenance, and then all you have is expendables that you would have with any car----tires, brakes.

sure if you chew through your rotors on a 911 that's more than a dodge omni, but the nicer you treat your porsche the nicer it treats you. :p"
695,"August 3, 2005 10:03AM",lemko,...and tell your wife to do the same! i had this crazy neighbor who fought with his wife all the time. one time she was throwing eggs at his black 911 cabriolet. those eggs must've wreaked havoc on that black finish in the blistering hot weather.
696,"August 3, 2005 10:34AM",Mr_Shiftright,"ah well, love dies but possessions are forever :p"
697,"August 3, 2005 12:00PM",jrosasmc,so are you saying that the 944 (and 968 for that matter) is a very maintenance-intensive car if you don't know what you are doing?
698,"August 3, 2005 2:31PM",Mr_Shiftright,"no i'm saying it's a very maintenance intensive car if you do know what you're doing. :p if you don't know what you're doing it will quickly become a very repair-intensive car.

but i have nothing against maintenance intensive cars, as this establishes a nice relationship between car and owner. i mean, oil and lubricants and adjustments don't have to be punishingly expensive.

it's the kind of car that you had better take care of, or else."
699,"August 4, 2005 6:46AM",lemmer,"the 944 bidding died out at $4550 with out reaching the reserve. they left me behind at $4450.

he will make it look like this, so i don't know why he doesn't just go ahead buy one already done"
700,"August 4, 2005 6:50AM",qbrozen,"that first link is busted ...

but, whereas i like the old broncos ... for a teenage son? first car, i presume? yikes!! now, granted, i looked at one myself for my first car ... and wound up with a cj7 instead ... but i think the roads are a different place these days (not that this was all that long ago ... and, probably, more likely, they aren't that different except in my mind since i don't feel i'm as invincible as i used to feel ... and since i actually need to get to where i'm going these days. lol!)

by the way .. on that second one, what the heck does this mean? 37 buckshots
is that how many holes they shot in it??"
701,"August 4, 2005 6:59AM",lemmer,"i fixed the link. you are really fast. don't you have some work to do this morning? obviously i don't.

37 buckshots - they are 37"" tires. buckshot is either a brand or a type of offroad tire. i am not sure which.

my friend is a bit of a country boy. his logic is that a big old truck like that can't get going too fast. i have asked him about safety features as well as the obvious braking and the handling questions, but he doesn't seem too concerned."
702,"August 4, 2005 7:06AM",qbrozen,"haha! no, i'm all caught up on my work at the moment (stayed late last night to make sure of that) ... waiting for the floodgates to open any minute now.

well, he's right about not getting going too fast ... but has he thought about the other things you can do with said truck? my brother and i both had good off-road vehicles in our youth ... and i can't begin to tell you the stupid things we would do with them. yeah, we couldn't get hurt going too fast on-road, but we sure as heck got hurt going too fast off-road."
703,"August 4, 2005 7:49AM",lemmer,"the 944 guy sent me an ebay second chance offer to buy the car for $5500. it might be worth it, but i will probably hold out for something without a brown interior."
704,"August 4, 2005 9:27AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i would personally never buy a porsche without eye-balling or having someone look it over.

i heard of a nice clean 944 for sale. i'll call on it and let you know.

reporting back---oh, it's a 924s....sorry......apparently a very nice car but still, it is what it is....."
705,"August 4, 2005 11:11AM",lemmer,"924s from '87 or '88 - that is almost the same thing as the 944, but with the old interior and no fender flares. how much does he want for that? or, more appropriately, how much is a nice 924s worth?"
706,"August 4, 2005 1:36PM",Mr_Shiftright,"yes, you know i forgot, you're right, a 924s is in fact all 944 drivetrain and chassis with a different body and interior.

basically what porsche did was use up all the extra 944 inventory by creating a new model.

story on this car is: it's beautiful, serviced at the porsche indy shop, and it has some extra goodies like cai and special throttle body---shop says ""it's a great car and it rocks"".

so, there you are, $4,500. but not a project car. it's done already. sports car market price guide spots a #2 car at $4,500-$6,000.

if you want, i'll go drive it for you."
707,"August 5, 2005 6:27AM",lemmer,"the car sounds nice. what are the colors?

i don't know how much shipping would be from ca to al, but i fear that it would be so much as to make the deal ineffective from a cost standpoint."
708,"August 5, 2005 7:49AM",lemmer,"original bronco

country boy bronco"
709,"August 5, 2005 7:53AM",andre1969,in original form. even with that tacky period burnt-orange paint. makes it a cool piece of 70's americana. be a shame to see it get all butchered and rednecked-up! are those seriously the going prices for those things nowdays?
710,"August 5, 2005 8:12AM",lemmer,"those are the two cheapest i could find in alabama. a lot of people are trying to sell broncos with some needs for closer to $10,000."
711,"August 5, 2005 10:08AM",Mr_Shiftright,"old suvs like that sell for only two prices....all fixed up real purty for a fairly high price, and real low price for a fixer-upper. anyone trying to sell a vehicle like this with needs for a strong price in the middle somewhere is going to be sucking wind waiting for a buyer---because all they've done is become discouraged with the project themselves."
712,"August 5, 2005 11:23AM",Mr_Shiftright,"colors are red exterior, black interior. car looks great except for a couple road chips on the nose and the seams of the driver seat cushion (bottom) have split. i'd rate the car as a high #3. mechanically it looks top notch---clean engine, very meaty tires---miles are good about 113k or so.

probably would cost $880--$1,000 to get it out there. if you flatbed it you don't have to pay calif. sales tax so that's $300 you ""save"" (of course you'll have to pay 'bama taxes, whatever they are). so maybe if you offer $4k, pay shipping, pay your sales tax, get the seat fixed, register the car, you're in total $5,500...that ain't bad...you'd get that as a payoff on a theft or third party total."
713,"August 11, 2005 6:59AM",lemmer,"you almost have me talked into it, but i am still kind of thinking that for $5,500, i think i would rather hold out for a 944. buying a cross-country car makes me a little nervous anyway."
714,"August 11, 2005 7:08AM",lemmer,"you have to check out the extra pictures that show the interior. why would someone offer over $1k for this kit?

the model scares me. she looks like one of the vampires in a cheesey horror movie you find on channel 87 at 2:00 am.

that kit car is weird, but i would be interested in seeing it in person, and with a paint job. probably not for the faint of heart.

723,"August 13, 2005 9:04AM",gsemike,"becoming a new homeowner and needing a second car for not too much money, i've been offered a 1993 buick lesabre with 114k for free. the car is basically straight but rough around the edges.

i'll drive it everyday for about 1 mile each way to the train. what do you think are the chances of getting a couple of relatively trouble free years out of it? what are the trouble spots on the car?

thanks,

mike"
724,"August 13, 2005 10:53AM",Mr_Shiftright,"here's my take on situations like this:

first of all, i'd take it and drive it vigorously for 1/2 hour and see if it breaks. does it overheat? does the heater work? ac work? wipers work? are the tires ready to shred? if not, all this is a very good sign. then i would proceed as follows:

1. car is free, but even free, no car is worth it if it isn't reliable. who wants to walk home at midnight, or freeze to death in winter or have to get into the car from the passenger side?

so.....

2. i'd invest $100 to have the car given a thorough going over for safety items and impending repairs.

3. once i have this list, i'd look it over and decide a) what can be deferred indefinitely, given the car's limited use b) what can be postponed a while until we see how the car is going to perform and c) what needs to be done immediately.

4. presuming that we have determined that the car is not a death trap, the question becomes----is it worth x dollars to make it safe and more reliable?

5. once i have the full inspection in hand, i can answer #4 intelligently."
725,"August 13, 2005 11:51AM",andys120,"what've you got to lose? if it breaks going to or from the train, you can walk home."
726,"August 13, 2005 12:56PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well for one thing trying to get rid of a broken and shabby 1993 buick is like trying to get rid of two tons of landfill.

i tried to get rid of a non-running 1986 mercury sable and absolutely, positively could not give that car away to anyone. i even put a big free sign on it with an explanation of what it needed.

i finally had to rent a flatbed and pay a recycler to take the car into the yard. $130 to dispose of it legally (i don't like to abandon vehicles on public roads, i find it anti-social behavior).

i think this car would be the same headache if it had a major breakdown.

fact is, in 2005 america, a 10-15 year old car of common mass-produced origin, and of pedestrian genetics, with a major component failure like bad engine or transmission, is literally worthless except for scrap, and turning it into scrap costs money, too."
727,"August 13, 2005 3:08PM",fintail,"this is dopey, but at the same time, i kind of like it

i think this is the same old caddy i saw awhile back"
728,"August 13, 2005 4:28PM",Mr_Shiftright,"the fiat would be great fun to drive i think--might be worth the money if the mods are really well done, but if someone offered him $3k he should take it.

the caddy is hardly ""rare and collectible"" except in the owner's dreams i fear. value? maybe $2,000, tops. if you can't do better than $2k in 28 years, chances are you are not going to be collectible in anybody's current lifetime. but it would be a decent ride for cheap. why do i think the owner thinks he's sitting on a gold mine of some sort? don't shoot the messenger."

how can you say such a thing about a fine motor car like a '93 buick lesabre, a car which one day will become the rage of pebble beach?"
730,"August 13, 2005 11:26PM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah, well i'll be long dead by then :p

it's not so much that it's a buick...any slightly banged up piece of early 90s american iron with a frozen motor would be equally unappealing to buyers i think. ditto 80s. it wasn't our golden age you might say.

but beats walking if the car runs and is for free."
731,"August 14, 2005 6:16AM",gsemike,"what i found out is that the car has a two year old transmission, 3 newish tires and a not ancient tune up. the current owner is a woman who drives it 7 highway miles to work.

it has a slow coolant leak of undetermined orgin and the ac blows hot.

thanks everyone for your feedback. i figured that if i hit the papers and carig's list for something under $2k, would i have any more conidence in whatever i got as opposed to this? not really unless i got lucky, so for free i'll see how it goes."
732,"August 14, 2005 6:35AM",hpmctorque,"if the coolant leak is coming from the intake manifold, it should be repaired promptly. otherwise, the engine's days are numbered. the 3.8's plastic composite manifold is the weak spot of this otherwise bullet proof engine.

i understand that this issue has be remedied in the new 3.8s"
733,"August 14, 2005 10:53AM",Mr_Shiftright,"might be that intake. if she blows white smoke, of course, that's real bad.

but your logic is basically good...you can't really buy a decent looking totally reliable car in america for under $2,000 anymore and really more like $3,500 on up if you want something where ""everything works"", and it doesn't look too shabby and its not a vicious gas-hog. i mean 8 mpg @ $3 a gallon would make even a ""free"" car expensive mighty quick.

(let's see what that works out to per mile....ouch .37 cents per mile!)"
734,"August 14, 2005 12:28PM",bumpy,"""you can't really buy a decent looking totally reliable car in america for under $2,000 anymore""

that's true for larger cars, but you can mid-90s sentras and corollas around here for that, and unembellished civics if you're willing to go back to '93 or so. california is probably different."
735,"August 14, 2005 12:44PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i kinda doubt it, not a car that is free of needs...i mean you may indeed find a car that runs and looks okay for under $2,000, but it'll have needs that would require $$ to put into my criteria of ""totally"" reliable.

or to put it another way, a clean good running car selling for $1,500 that needs tires all around, one headlight and a driver's window regulator is in fact a $2,000 car if not more. these are items that can't be ignored.

if you're willing to ""go shabby"" then the equation changes---cars with body damage, etc., can run just fine but of course are worth very little."
736,"August 14, 2005 1:40PM",fintail,"here's a car...i need to get a pic. my dad just picked up a 70k mile 1 owner 1976 datsun 610 sedan, red with grey interior. automatic, little else, dry eastern wa car. he paid $150 for it and says he's been enjoying it for the past week. claims he's getting 30mpg too.

i am guessing it looks like this

""vip"" must mean something other than very important person"
737,"August 14, 2005 3:11PM",Mr_Shiftright,"cutlass looks pretty good---might be worth the price.

the vip might be ready for the wrecker unless it is maybe super super sharp in every other respect. rebuilding a 383 with a rod knock means a new crank, so that means a short block, so that means $3,500 on up by the time you're done getting all the other pieces on it. (belts,hoses, mounts, service, labor, blah, blah).

datsun 610 -- not a good car but you can't beat the price."
738,"August 14, 2005 4:09PM",fintail,"i posted the vip as a joke. kind of a funny name for a car that at the time was big 'n cheap.

somehow, that 610 seems right up my dad's alley. he seems to like some oddball cars. he wanted the 510 wagon i had for a short time, but he had too many cars as it was. i've told him to detail it and he could probably sell it to some datsun nut for a good markup."
739,"August 14, 2005 4:59PM",Mr_Shiftright,"probably he'd be searching a long time for a datsun 610 ""nut"". i'm not sure where the local chapter of the datsun 610 restoration society is in his area---best to market it as a cheap ride that you throw away when it breaks. if it runs okay he could get $750 for it without doing anything else to it. just flip it fast...okay, vacuum the dog hair and empty the ash tray."
740,"August 14, 2005 5:00PM",ghulet,"i have a friend who is selling his '93 (i think) sc2 for $600--claims everything except the power sunroof works, even the a/c. it's a 5-speed, has manual windows and locks, factory stereo. i don't know how many miles are on it, the tires looked ok, body was fine, it was even in a non-objectionable color (dark blue with gray cloth), which is always a 50/50 gamble on old saturns (i've seen too many in aqua, purple and that sort of pinkish burgandy). i really hadn't planned on buying a car, don't especially need one, but at the price, it'd be ok to have one around for when the roommates are both gone with theirs. also, it's good on gas (which is now over $3 a gallon at some stations near me). i'll have to check it out further, drive it and report back. not my choice of cars, but i'm sure it's a good sight nicer than any $600 honda or toyota i could find (i know, i had one!)."
741,"August 14, 2005 6:26PM",fintail,"ha shifty...maybe to an orphanage for ugly cars.

he was actually talking about selling his town-runaround car (a strippo 94 ram with vinyl seats/manual windows etc) and keeping the datsun, as the mileage is so much better. i guess someone has to like it.

if it's mechanically sound, and starts/stops, you probably can't go wrong for $600. many simple parts on newer cars cost more than that,"
742,"August 14, 2005 7:00PM",Mr_Shiftright,"you could give it the old ""under $1,000 used car test"" which means take it and drive the hell out of it for 1/2 hour. if nothing breaks or leaks or starts shrieking in agony it's probably a good car. it's hard to mask bad problems in a 1/2 hour vigorous road test."
743,"August 14, 2005 7:06PM",gsemike,"i appreciate the feedback, but here in ny, a truly decent civic or coralla can not be had for $1500 or $2k. especially with the civics getting scooped up by the fast and the furious crowd, i'm amazed at how many 10 yo, 100k cars are going between 4 and 5 grand. a dealer guy in my neighborhood has a 95 corolla with 108k for $3800. it's a decent enough car, but i'll go with the lesabre for free.

the sentras do go for less than the other two cars, but they're also never clean by the time you get into the 10 yo range."

746,"August 15, 2005 9:30AM",jaserb,"i was helping my brother look for something ""cheap and cheerful"" to drive around for a couple of years. unless you're willing and able to do some mechanical work i really think you're looking at $3k+ before i'd have any real confidence in a car. i looked at a lot of $1-2k beaters that i was afraid to drive around the block. my current daily driver is a 1992 dodge ram 50 4x4 - rebadged mitsubishi. bought for $1500 a year ago, and immediately had to put a junkyard transmission and new clutch in. since i did it myself it was still cost effective. since then i've done a lot of little things - new tires, timing belt, front shocks, some niggling electrical issues, even got the a/c working - and it's really pretty good now. looks good, drives fine, and it has the utility of being a truck, and a 4x4 to boot. i drive it everywhere - but it took a bit of work to get it back in decent shape. if something expensive goes wrong i'll dump it for parts.

back to my brother. we finally found him a really nice looking, super well maintained '91 maxima for $3100. it has 130k miles but looks and drives very well, and has had tons of recent service done - brand new michelins, a/c charged, new alternator and battery, t-belt, hoses, tranny flush, the works. i'm confident he can get another 50k out of it, where some of the other cars he drove - like the $1k '94 protege - i doubt he could get another 50 miles out of. that max was a real find, as most other cars that were that solid and ready to go were in the $4-$5k range.

my rambling point? take the free buick. you're not getting something more reliable without spending some real money.

752,"September 7, 2005 7:55AM",andre1969,"probably means that they went down to the automotive paint store and picked out a lexus color instead of a toyota color. heck, might even be the same color between both, but just called something different for each brand."

756,"September 7, 2005 9:02AM",Mr_Shiftright,"toyota sunchaser isn't worth much. oddly enough you see them for sale more often than you'd think, and usually beat to hell. old japanese cars from the 80s don't wear very well. i'd say a clean un-chopped stock coupe would be worth more actually, since the chop job severely compromises the car.

corvette: 700hp? oh, sure.....try 450 if he did what he said he did. too bad for the guy, though, all that work wiped out by one bonehead driver. now you know why so many used vipers in hemmings motor news are shown as damaged. people have to learn that hp is useless if you can't put it on the ground."

758,"September 7, 2005 11:16AM",andre1969,"of the old '79-83 corolla and '79-83 200sx hardtops? seems to me that they would've been better candidates than the celica, since they already had roll-down rear windows and no b-pillar. seems to me one of those would've looked much more complete. i see those celica sunchasers on occasion and yeah, usually all beat to hell. wonder how hard it would be these days to get replacement top parts?

for some reason, another car that seemed popular to turn into a convertible was the 80's cutlass ciera and century coupe. i've seen a few of those. i've also seen a few monte carlos from that era that were chopped. oddly, the conversion seems to work on the ciera/century, but the monte looks very awkward, top up or down."
759,"September 7, 2005 12:12PM",Mr_Shiftright,"being ""rare"" isn't always an asset. often a car is rare because nobody wanted it in the first place--hardly a collectible car.

the reason manufacturers stopped making convertibles was that nobody was buying them. there is this ""fable"" about them being ""outlawed"" or that they didn't met ""federal safety standards"" which is total hogwash.

what happened was much simpler----the convertible market fell apart. there were buyers, but too few to justify the expense of making these cars.

$4,000 would be more than fair, perhaps a tad generous considering what you get---a loosey-goosey, rather dull to drive, odd-looking old japanese car."
760,"September 7, 2005 12:39PM",stickguy,"would that be the ""beta"" model of the alpha you would get??"
761,"September 7, 2005 12:41PM",ghulet,"....i have seen convertible versions of both the 200sx and the '80-83 corolla, usually in some putrid era-specific color scheme (like brown with tan vinyl interior, in both cases). both were 'full' convertibles, as opposed to this metal basket-handle targa top 'cabrio' thing we see in that celica. the way japanese cars rusted back then, i don't think i'd want one with its structure compromised even more. plus, i just had skin cancer removed, i seriously doubt i'll ever be in the market for a convertible!"
762,"September 7, 2005 12:48PM",andre1969,"that probably killed the convertible in the 70's was the increasing popularity of air conditioning, and downsizing. way back in 1957, for example, i think air conditioning cost about $500. that was an awful lot of money considering that a chevy, ford, or plymouth usually started around $2,000, and mid-line cars like my desoto firedome, about as mid-line as it gets, started around $3,000. iirc, the base price of my hardtop desoto was something like $3085. a convertible might have cost around $250-300 over that, so it was cheaper to just go with a convertible than to go with air conditioning!

by the mid-late 60's though, air conditioning was down to around $350 or so. it would go up again in the 70's, but so did everything else.

as for downsizing, well a lot of pre-downsized cars weren't too space-efficient. and usually the coupes were worse than the sedans. for instance, while a '77 caprice sedan is about as big inside as a '76 (main loss was in shoulder room), a '77 caprice coupe is much bigger inside than a '76 (big improvement in rear seat legroom). well, with a convertible, the top and folding mechanism pretty much made use of that wasted space...gave it someplace to tuck down inside, without giving up too much back seat room or trunk space. however, when the cars were downsized, in many cases they started making more use of that wasted space. further, while the actual cars were smaller, the roofs were often as large or larger than the pre-downsized cars, and taller to boot, so there was still a whole lot of roof and mechanism, that had to fold down into an even smaller space.

a '75 caprice convertible can still hold 3 people in the back seat, although legroom's a bit tight. and it still has a mammoth trunk. but if they tried to make a convertible out of a '77 caprice coupe, the trunk capacity probably would have been reduced to about the size of a compact nova, and the back seat would have shrunk to a two seater.

it's no coincidence that the vast majority of convertibles these days are cars that, in closed coupe form, had marginal or non-existent back seats to begin with. nobody buys a mustang for the back seat to begin with..it's only there to keep insurance costs down, and for an occasional third passenger. so it's really no big deal to sacrifice the back seat and trunk for a top that goes down.

as for the whole federal rollover thing, there actually is a grain of truth to that fable. the feds were proposing strict new rollover standards, which the current crop of convertibles and hardtops would have been unable to meet. in anticipation of this, gm eliminated those styles from their midsized lineup when it was redesigned for 1973. instead, they took the 2-door sedan, normally the dumpiest model in a lineup, and gave it sleeker, sportier styling. and 4-door hardtops were never popular in midsized cars anyway, so that was no big loss. gm was the only one that consistently offered that style, anyway. ford did for like 2 years, maybe 1970-71. and chrysler offered them around 1962-64. for the most part though, the 4-door hardtop was the domain of full-sized cars, and then mainly the pricier models.

anywho, the rollover standards never materialized, so gm was left holding the bag. i believe that rumor also influenced the full-sized cars a bit, too. for '75-76 the big c-body coupes lost their pillarless styling altogether, going for the opera window look. and in '74, the buick/olds/pontiac b-bodies went to a different type of hardtop coupe roofline, that had a smaller roll-down window and fixed triangular window in the c-pillar.

the hardtop is another style that was pretty much killed by downsizing, although it was gradually phasing out, anyway. most of the downsized cars had more glass area, which would mean a larger window to roll down. back then it was rare to get a back window to roll down all the way even with a sedan with a quarter window in the door...a hardtop would've been almost impossible to do."
763,"September 7, 2005 2:24PM",Mr_Shiftright,"andre, you are too kind to gm, you should get a job in buffing up their corporate image, money well spent for them---when was the last time gm ever ""anticipated"" a federal regulation and acted beforehand? they have always been dragged kicking and screaming to comply with any regulation from the government. i can't recall one single instance of gm introducing anything pre-emptively in safety or emissions. they even fought the pcv valve tooth and nail in the 1960s.

like we used to say in the 1980s -- ""when the feds came out with a new regulations, honda called its engineers and gm called its lawyers."""
764,"September 7, 2005 2:35PM",andre1969,"to be kind to gm, but just stating facts, or at least, what i've read in the past from various sources (consumer guide, collectible automobile, etc). i mean, c'mon, i'm not just going to make something like that up!

besides, wouldn't it be more my character to apologize for something stupid that chrysler did, than gm? :p maybe lemko can take that pr job for gm. :shades:

plus, gm rushed a lot of stuff to the market in the 1970's, which is one reason why a lot of it didn't work right...it was rushed! the olds diesel, the pontiac 301 v-8 (weighed less than some 6-cyl blocks, pretty efficient, but prone to early self destruction), the lightweight thm200c transmission, the v-8-6-4, the vega aluminum 4-cyl, the 231 v-6 (similar problems as the pontiac 301...too lightweight and fragile).

gm was also pretty quick to the market with 4-speed overdrive transmission, bringing one out in 1981. it was a year after ford, though. chrysler wouldn't have one until 1989, though. i don't think gm had a 4-speed fwd tranny until 1984 though, and ford wouldn't have one until the 1986 taurus. the japanese were a bit late in coming out with their own 4-speed trannies, but once they did, they made the switchover quicker, offering them in even the more basic cars. in contrast, chrysler wouldn't start putting a 4-speed in it's compact neon until 2002...and by that time, 5-speeds were starting to gain in popularity!"
765,"September 7, 2005 2:42PM",andre1969,"what about those airbags gm was experimenting around with in the 70's? it's a shame they never caught on. imo they weren't that expensive. around 1975, a dual airbag system cost something like $335. it was actually more expensive to add fuel injection to a '75 deville than it was airbags!"
766,"September 7, 2005 5:36PM",andre1969,"of aftermarket convertibles, one of the prettiest ones from those dark disco days that i remember seeing was an early 80's dodge mirada that a local dealership had on their lot back in the early 90's. it was a midnight blue, and memory's getting fuzzy now, but i think it had a white leather interior. gorgeous with the top down, but horrible with it up, not to mention some killer blind spots! i think they wanted around $12,000 for it back then! :surprise:

evidently, there was a conversion or two done to the 81-83 imperial...

770,"September 7, 2005 8:07PM",Mr_Shiftright,"buying a cracked up corvette can be a big challenge. it's a real skill to make the car look good again. another tricky thing is that some people think ""oh, they're fiberglass, they never rust"". oh, yeah? what about the frame?"
771,"September 8, 2005 7:00AM",lemmer,"i don't think i would want that vette for anything. the engine might not be all he has cracked it up to be. the rest of the car looks like it was a pretty average example of a less desirable corvette - before it was wrecked.

the toyota might be an ok toy for a couple of thousand, but once you get into cheap older miata territory, it doesn't make sense to me. come to think of it, i would rather have a nice early mr2 for $2-3k."

773,"September 8, 2005 7:31AM",andre1969,"or the owner didn't like the '72 grille, because that one looks like it's sporting a '71 front end! pretty bad paintjob, too. i like the way you can see the original off white/creme color in the doorjambs! it has potential, but not for $4200!! '72 was probably the last year i really liked the dart. they went to a somewhat pretentious beaky front end that i didn't care for in '73, and i think the emissions controls were starting to choke it off a bit after '72, as well. a 318 is an excellent motor in these cars, though...plenty of kick in the relatively lightweight body."
774,"September 8, 2005 7:42AM",lemmer,"what is the other green car in the pictures? a duster, maybe?"
775,"September 8, 2005 8:09AM",stickguy,the lime green one looks like a duster. i actually like that one better (my 2nd car was a '73 duster). a 340/4 speed sounds good.
776,"September 8, 2005 8:16AM",andre1969,"that light green one is either a '73 or '74 duster. i think they used the same grille both years. that lime green looks to be more of a correct color, too. normally i like greens, but i just don't like that shade of green that ended up on that dart! maybe if the doorjambs were painted to match, and it had a better-matching interior i'd like it better."

actually somebody will always fix a 911. my friend's shop always seems to have 2-3 in restoration process (he only does the mechanicals).

part of the reason is for this that a 20 year old porsche still looks great and still looks something like a new one. but you need to start with a sound body. a porsche with underbelly rust is worthless and must be discarded, since the body is the frame."

'69s are not the absolute favorite, but they're right behind the '64-68s, and this one looks nice--not restored, not abused, and has the nice 'almost original owner' story. i smell a rat, someone who hasn't done any research as to how much this car is really worth (i'd say twice that, if the pictures are any indication), or the thing's not nearly as nice as the description or photos indicate. i'm going to check ebay, this could be a scam."
789,"September 14, 2005 8:18PM",fintail,"yeah something is up. either it's really a heap or the seller is a fraud. if it's as good as it looks it should be worth quite a bit more than 4k, and would sell fast in these musclecar crazed (not saying this is a musclecar, but it has looks) times."
790,"September 14, 2005 9:41PM",Mr_Shiftright,"actually the price is close to market correct. 1969 plain vanilla mustang coupe is a very common and ordinary car. depends if the engine compartment and under-chassis is funky or sharp. if funky, $4k is plenty, if sharp all around, figure $6k is all the money. looks like a car you might be able to clean up and flip for a small profit at $4k.

the money for these cars is in the engines."
791,"September 14, 2005 10:17PM",ghulet,"....considering this car is in il, it's far from ordinary, imo; maybe in ca it is. i mean, no, it's not a gt/mach/cj/boss, but it is a v8 (strange the seller doesn't specify which one) fastback (though strangely, in '68, coupes sold 6:1 versus fastbacks, in '69, fastbacks outnumbered coupes by 10k units; actually, mach fastbacks outsold base fastbacks by 10k units also). most notable to me, though, is that (the seller claims) it's original, not modified nor owned by five different idiot teenagers over the last twenty-odd years, never sat on blocks in bubba's back yard. the interior is beautiful and original, highly unusual for a pony car this age. ok, it's not a $15k car, but considering the heaps i see on ebay for more than this, $4k is a straight up give-away price, i could see this getting $7500 here pretty easily if it's described accurately. it's tough in illinois to get any nice old car for less than $5k, let alone a mustang. i do agree people buy pony cars (though i'd say camaros more than mustangs) for the engines, which is a shame, i'd buy one because they're pretty, and considering a modern accord v6 would eat most mustangs for lunch at this point, why focus on the engine? i mean, they weigh two tons and get 12mpg, they can't be too fun to have around. i'll have to keep checking craigslist and see if anyone flags it."

i personally hate white on that car, and don't want an at, but at that price and if the bones eally are sound, it should be a nice platform for a mile build up. although i usually like survivors, there doesn't seem to be much upside to keeping this one all original."

re: 911 used engine --- figure $3,500 for a good used engine and then labor to install + miscellaneous parts, like new clutch, reseal valve covers, oil, filters, tune up, blah blah.....maybe $5,500 total if nothing goes wrong. contrary to popular belief, r&r-ing a 911 engine is not quite ""like putting in a vw engine"".

bogus cars on craigslist --- yep, lots of that going on. then they'll tell you the car is really in indonesia or mexico city but they'd be happy and pleased and honored to send it to you, if you would only be so kind as to send a cashier's check for shipping, etc....blah, blah, and the scamming begins."

shame about the fender damage. if it was hit hard enough in the parking lot to push it into a parked car so that both fenders got damaged, i'd imagine that there might be hood issues as well. and i'm sure the bumper/grille combo got pinched between the two and distorted! and i'm sure it's a turn off to a lot of people, but i absolutely love that shade of green! :shades:

if all it needed were the two fenders and some interior work, i might be tempted. but i'm sure there's more to it."

in contrast, i think the '61-62 has kind of a youthful, sporty flair about it. the main thing that would worry me would be the engine, though. i don't think those little aluminum v-8's were reliable when new, but now here's a 43 year old one with 140,000 miles on that engine?! also, i thought these cars only had a 2-speed automatic?

as far as that '71 caddy goes, the color is a real killer for me. just doesn't seem like it belongs on a cadillac! i could probably stomach it on a full-sized mopar from that era, or a pontiac, with a light colored interior. but it just don't seem just on a caddy!"

on the bugeye, i would not bother with the engine unless it crapped out. just don't show it off. it's like with that lwb fintail...i showed it to some old mb people, and one suggested swapping the horribly complex gullwing-based m189 6cyl in it for a m103 6cyl out of a 124 e or 126 s. that would be interesting."

854,"September 21, 2005 11:29AM",ghulet,"...i actually do like the 67-68 chevies, but the four-doors more than the two-door fastbacks. i love that buick, that's one of my favorites (the body style and the fact that it's a wildcat). the interior is great, i love the seat pattern. i think the longer wheelbase and overall 'largerness' of the buicks (and oldsmobiles) of this era lend themselves better to the fastback roofline. also, the buick/olds don't have that 'liquid' look at the top of the rear fenders like the chevies, the overall look is cleaner. last, the bigger (i think, anyway) wheels on the more expensive cars help them look a little less pontoon-like.

reminds me of a very sad story of a guy whose almost identical car (67 wildcat 4ht) was wrecked on the way home from a car show by some idiot kid; i think someone was killed, might have been the driver of the wildcat. if i can find the link, i'll post it.

now for something completely different, and almost as scary:

an abused ten year-old volvo turbo with 130k. let's see, a little body work (more than the $150 claimed seems likely), a 'shouldn't be too expensive' blower motor (if they're anything like saabs, ha!), and, oh yeah, the motor smokes sometimes when running at idle. aye yi yi, can't imagine why he's selling. so buy this for two grand, put three grand in repairs (i bet), and !viola! you have a car worth $3500 on a good day. the rear-right side photo looks nice, anyway."
855,"September 21, 2005 11:42AM",lemmer,"i am very afraid of that volvo.

probably needs a new engine fairly soon as well as a complete paint job. why does the hood look like that anyway - did it already have a cheapy paint job when fixing some previous damage? who knows? maybe it is good as a beater if you can get it to last a year without something major dying, but good luck with that.

who wants to take a chance on a gt4 with no records?"
856,"September 21, 2005 11:43AM",fintail,"i think the 65-66 impala 4 door hts look good too, nice and clean. those were good years for gm as a whole. i still remember the positively mint low mile 65 caprice 4 door ht that turned up at a local small town chevy dealer about 10 years ago. it was a nice 2 tone grey/silver iirc, it had a silver brocade interior still under seat covers, looked as-new. they wanted 6k or something for it...it sold fast. it was a 396. i probably should have tried to buy it...but at age 19 and being tethered to a fintail, i couldn't.

i think that buick is worth saving for someone. it's cheap, looks usable as is, and is simple. horrible mileage i am sure, but that's part of having an old car.

re: bi-turbo -- there is a tragic thing about this car. it cannot be fixed to run right. that's right, it is impossible. not the best genius with all the money in the world could make this car right (unless they yanked out the engine and threw it over a fence of course). this is one of a few truly ""unfixable"" cars, at least not fixable for any discernible or credible length of time. the triumph tr7 is another, the saab 99e another (cousins of a sort). some ""bad"" cars can be fixed and remain more or less stock, like the triumph stag and the jaguar xj6, but a maser bi-turbo, well lots of luck and may god have mercy on your soul. this is the worst car in the entire world and probably that includes other solar systems as well. i'm not sure what the ""2nd worst car in the world is"" -- probably the tr7 and maybe the triumph gt6. even a chevy vega you can sleeve the engine.

re: the agony of shiftright

well, we finally got the new clutch in the porsche 928. what a diff. it shifts like, as they say in new york, ""like buddah"". seems that the throw out bearing disintegrated and wiped out the pressure plate. note to readers: do not drive too long with a noisy throw out bearing.

so we are now $1,000 poorer (double disk clutch, but you don't have to remove the transmission!). next agony, the water pump. one of those ""while you're in there"" jobs. the timing belt is something like 7 feet long! this should be fun.

but you know, you take a camry v-6 in california and go to a shop and have the water pump, timing belt, all hoses and all belts and various seals redone, and it's gonna be $900 bucks anyway. at $120 an hour labor, there is no escape out here for high repair bills--even a japanese car cannot save you."
872,"September 22, 2005 7:35AM",lemmer,does the 928 shift better than a '99 z28 now? please tell me it does.
873,"September 22, 2005 7:43AM",Mr_Shiftright,"lol! it shifts smoother but since it has very beefy gears it doesn't shift faster. but the z28 shifter feels like it might break off in your hands at any moment. got to admit, the z trans itself is a good sturdy unit.

another funny thing about that z28---previous owner reports that the ""check engine light"" has been on for over 3 years and that nobody anywhere in the world has been able to shut it off-- a suggestion to drive a metal punch through the dash display was rejected.

oh, ---i pressed the power window switch and it fell in the door---honest. that's okay, my porsche power window glass did the same thing a few months ago.

this is old car blues -- after many miles of hard use, you have no idea what weird things might happen----metal fatigue, and age-related stress on parts."
874,"September 22, 2005 8:23AM",fintail,"""the only reason i'm selling is because i can't afford the body work"" is not a good sign

catalina for andre...a bit of a fixer upper"
875,"September 22, 2005 8:29AM",stickguy,"hard to tell from the pics, but looks lke it could be a good project if you want to do the work yourself, but that depends on how bad the rust is where you can't see it, and how bad you want a '68 baracuda, which probably isn't worth that much anyway (maybe a clean 383, certainly a rare hemi). buy cheap, work yourself, don't dump in too much money, and have fun.

the catalina? i would say why bother listing it, but the ads are free. car not worth that much.

also saw another survivor for andre, at the bottom of the chevbo listing (other ebay listings): a 1974 chrysler newport, with 55k original miles. looked good, but what a barge!

actually, that place in idaho seems to be project cars gone wild heaven. also noticed a nova wagon pro street oddity, and a '72 cuda that i didn't look at."
876,"September 22, 2005 8:37AM",lemmer,"i see nothing but an upside on that catalina. i mean it even ""ran when parked."""
877,"September 22, 2005 9:21AM",stickguy,"there are an amazing number of cars that ran perfectly, but the owner decided to park it in a field and not touch it for 10 years anyway!

even if it did, might not matter much at this point 9since sitting unprepped outdoors for a long time isn't likely to help the engine much)."
878,"September 22, 2005 9:26AM",Mr_Shiftright,"you mean ""ran into a tree and then parked""? :p

well now...you could probably buy this car really nice for $15,000. so we have to ask, if you threw $15k at this wreck what would you have? you'd have about 50% of a nice '67 catalina.

yeah, i love the ""ran when parked comment"". i can hear the owner now:

""yep, i loved this car. always wanted to restore it, but never quite had the time. so i decided to park it outside, leave the windows open and remove the spark plugs, and abandon it for 15 years. sure gonna miss it, just hate to sell 'er""."
879,"September 22, 2005 9:49AM",andre1969,"i have no idea what my '67 catalina would be worth these days, but i only paid $3775 for it! of course, that was way back in 1994... still, $15,000 sunk into that wreck of a '67 probably wouldn't even get it as nice as mine!

i wonder what they did to it to get the grille like that? :surprise: i know that the beaky pontiacs with the bumper/grille combination had a habit of distorting somewhat like that in a rear-end collision. my cousin's ex-wife rear-ended a car with their '69 bonneville (the one i ultimately bought), and it pushed the beak in, and popped the outer parts of it outward. however, whatever they did to this '67 took talent! i don't think it was in a very hard accident, because otherwise i'd think the hood would be damaged. there's a metal part that sits above the bumper/grille and ahead of the hood, that holds the upper headlights, and i'd think that in an accident, it would push back into the hood and damage it.

but, who knows? maybe the doors and glass might be salvageable, and the hood, trunk, taillights, and some interior trim? i wonder how rotten the rear quarter panels are? i also wonder how long ago it was ""parked""?"
880,"September 22, 2005 10:13AM",fintail,"yeah, the catalina is a sad $100 parts car...i just thought andre would get a kick out of it

locally i have seen more than one old broken down mess described as ""ran at one time"" - you don't say! it was a new car at one time, too."
881,"September 22, 2005 10:18AM",lemko,...sometime back in the carter administration.
882,"September 22, 2005 10:54AM",andre1969,"ran when parked. i parked it on a spot in my grandmother's yard that i thought was out of the way, but then a few weeks later, my uncle decided he wanted to chop down a nearby mulberry tree. i went to start up the car, which had been running fine until then, and it refused to start. i ended up having to chain it to my nyer and pull it out of the way!

and naturally, i put it in another spot in the yard that i thought was out of the way...near two locust trees that, a couple months later, my uncle decided he wanted to have taken down. so i had to move it again!

but, it ran when i parked it! :p"
883,"September 22, 2005 11:09AM",martian,"the car is in decnt shpe-but needs new fron caliper 9old ones frozen). a spot of exterior rust on rear quarter panels, paint is faded badly 9but still ok color). interior: shabby-lots of spiderwebs and mouse droppings-rotted upholstery, but seat springs ok. the engine leaks oil, compression on cylinders 1 and 2 marginal (head gasket)?
i realize this an oddball, but i've always like the loks.
1st question: are parts available?
2nd: will this ever be worth more than a few hundered dollars?
3rd-are there so few around that the car will have some value in 10-20 years?"
884,"September 22, 2005 11:19AM",andre1969,"that a '58 golden hawk in that condition would still be worth saving. it seems like hawks have had a pretty good survival rate, and i see them occasionally at car shows and swap meets, so somebody's finding a way to restore them and get parts for them! i'd imagine it's the ""regular"" studebakers, like the upright, clunky sedans and hardtops from that era, that would be next to impossible to find parts for.

i think the hawks are a bit of a minor collectible. they'll probably never be in the same league as a '57 chevy bel air convertible with fuel injection, but still a cut above a typical sedan from that timeframe."
885,"September 22, 2005 11:39AM",fintail,looks like a nice old land yacht for a grand
886,"September 22, 2005 11:41AM",andre1969,i really like that one! wonder how much the fuel bill would be to get it back here?
887,"September 22, 2005 11:43AM",lemmer,i don't like it. to me it is the equivalent of a minivan of the '70s. just looking at reminds me of being carsick and fighting with my big sister on long trips. shudder.
888,"September 22, 2005 11:47AM",michaellno,"wow .. i oughta buy that and give it to my daughter to drive.

seems to be in pretty good condition.

how about these?

a free porsche! oh, you mean i have to supply the engine, transmission, interior and wheels and tires?

again, perhaps too much to ask for this

and. to top things off for today, we present this:

why would anyone average 1500 miles a year in something like this?"
889,"September 22, 2005 11:48AM",fintail,probably something like 2800 miles...can't imagine that thing getting more than 15mpg...at $3/gal that comes to $560 i guess
890,"September 22, 2005 11:50AM",fintail,"you could probably do worse than that cimarron. remove the cheesy tint and take it to gm shows as a special interest car.

that impala is several times more than it should be."

892,"September 22, 2005 11:57AM",lemmer,"i like the camaro for about $1200.

the guy should put the porsche on ebay. some fool would pay something for it.

the impala is really making me want to puke. we had a brown '76 4-door. huge engine, go slow - bad combination.

i posted a cimmaron a couple of weeks ago that wasn't as nice. i think it sold for something like $835."
893,"September 22, 2005 12:02PM",lemmer,"if it doesn't scare old ladies and children, what it the point?

896,"September 22, 2005 12:42PM",stickguy,"for free, i would take it and drag it home, just to play with. it would give me an excuse to buty a welder and some tolls, just to use it as a cadaver to practice on.

900,"September 22, 2005 1:45PM",andre1969,"we'll see these boats for sale up at carlisle, and they'll want $10-15k or more for them. now granted, it's hard to tell what's up with the mark iv i found near me just from that one pic. it just shocked me though, because it was a price that actually seemed reasonable, that i'd be willing to pay! as opposed to the general carlisle rule of slashing it in half and then coming down from there if it still seems too high! :p"
901,"September 22, 2005 2:44PM",andre1969,"andre is in lust!

this one's kinda purty, too

i think i prefer the '76, mainly because i think the front-end is a cleaner, sleeker design. also, i wonder where the seller got the notion that the '75 has overdrive? :confuse: gm wouldn't come out with an overdrive tranny until 1981, and trust me, you wouldn't want it connected to a 455! in '75, i don't think they were even using lock up torque convertors yet.

dangit, i really need to stay off ebay!!"
902,"September 22, 2005 2:47PM",fintail,seems the common theme is that there are plenty of interesting affordable (<5k) old cars on cl and ebay. maybe not investments...but good hobby cars.
903,"September 22, 2005 2:50PM",michaellno,"could that buick be any bigger?

however, with a bid of $500, you could have lots of money left over to restore it, take it to carlisle, and get $7-9k for it!"

906,"September 23, 2005 8:38AM",fintail,"unusual volvo

if it's not rusty, these are becoming more unusual

if its as good as it looks, you could do worse for the money"
907,"September 23, 2005 8:45AM",lemmer,"i finally got an answer on the 944 turbo that was a daily driver that needs work. here is a portion of the answer. brace yourself.

i bought the car from a private seller in anniston, al on december 29, 1997. when i bought the car it had 32,978 miles on the odometer. on the way home, i noticed the odometer stopped working.

after driving the car for about 5 months, it suffered catastrophic engine failure. after towing it to my mechanic, he said the crankshaft had ""spun"". whatever that means. i planned to have it rebuilt by a performance porsche shop, but realized 10 grand wasn't just lying around. so, i parked it, bought a 1988 rx-7 turbo to drive, and started saving.

during this time i also discovered carfax and learned more about my car. it had been titled in the northeast with 100k+ mileage. and some years later, this car had miraculously turned back the hands of time and had 20-something thousand miles on it. by the time i bought it, it had returned to a little over 30k.

4 years later, i bought a used '87 turbo engine from an auto recycler in south carolina. i also ordered many new parts (clutch/flywheel/pressure plate, intercooler, engine mounts, etc. i have all records.)and had a local porsche certified shop install the engine. since then,(april, 2002) i have driven the car as my ""daily driver"" to work at a school about 18 miles from my home. literally ""highway miles"".

i've done minor work to the car since then:

new axle assemblies(cv joints, boots and axles), both
replaced coolant reservoir
new brake rotors/pads (4)

the bulk of the work was done during the engine swap. everything that was not in great condition was replaced in the engine bay, including the power steering pump, and many other accessory pumps. the timing belt was also replaced then.

here are things that are wrong with the car now:

a/c compressor/condenser were never replaced after the collision.
headlight lift motor- i don't drive it much at night
tachometer/boost gauge- hasn't worked since the transplant
parking brake cable should be replaced soon
shifter bushings could be replaced
driver switch for passenger window (passenger switch is fine)
passenger seat height adjustment
weather stripping around the windshield should be replaced
climate controls (fan still blows)
needs rearview mirror
the original nose panel above the front bumper had been slowly deteriorating at the bolts and eventually came loose while i was driving on the interstate. it was completely bent-up and couldn&#146;t be saved. i have ordered a new, oem nose panel, and endeavored to have it painted and mounted, but i just want to sell the car instead. the nose panel is, of course included.
it also uses coolant pretty quickly (i add fluid every couple weeks). this could be a coolant reservoir cap problem, as the rubber seal on the inside of it is gone.
there is a small tear (see picture) in the middle of the bumper.
there is a gap (1/8 inch) between the hatch glass and the hatch. this sometimes leaks.
shocks and shock mounts need to be replaced. this is the most recent (9-19) problem with the car. the wheel bearings were replaced on 9-16, along with the driver side stabilizer bar mount and an engine mount. after these repairs, i noticed a knocking noise from the front of the car. i took it back on monday and that was the verdict."
908,"September 23, 2005 8:50AM",andre1969,"here's a cute little pup

i think i'd be afraid of an aluminum engine that was bored out, though! :surprise:

and here's something for fintail"
909,"September 23, 2005 9:16AM",Mr_Shiftright,"he may mean that the engine was sleeved. neat car, priced way too high.

re: porsche turbo ----- aye yi yi.....somebody put it out of its misery....mein gott!!!

re: canadian volvo -- a 122 with the borg warner two speed automatic? can you say woof woof!!? it's a $750 car all day long with body damage, but it could probably be squared away for another $1,500 or so and made into a nice grandma putt putt sunday car to take the kids for ice cream. harumf....more dumping on su carburetors....people just don't know how good they really are!

katrina benz -- hard to say....sounds good, but...these old coupes are such cows, pardon the expression....very heavy, very rust prone for some reason....but if it ran well and had no major issues, $3,000 isn't at all unreasonable.....but i'd sure go over that body with a fine tooth comb. i actually saw one break in half after an accident, all due to rust. nice highway car though....a german buick....sort of like driving a 3 bedroom house with a turning radius to match. as you can tell, not my favorite old benz. a 280se coupe would be so much better in every respect."
910,"September 23, 2005 9:58AM",fintail,"i've never heard of the canadian volvo before...i know volvo built cars in canada, but that's the first time i've seen that badge. might sell better in canada.

that 220se coupe warrants further inspection. if it is roadworthy and sound, it'd be a good driver at that price. the engine is a sound unit, if not clattery and revvy. it's for all intents and purposes a fintail coupe. as shifty mentions, rust is the big issue...60s mb just like to rust. appears to have euro fogs with na headlights...either they were added or it is a euro car. you want the former. it's also on early 70s wheels and the color is likely not original. a lot of these cars got cosmetic updates in the early 70s to look more like the pricey 280se cars."
911,"September 23, 2005 10:35AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i don't think i've ever seen one of those early coupes that wasn't a lead sled...as you may know, most of these now in the usa were not us imports but rather euro cars. the germans won't allow a rusted car on the roads like we do, so america ended up with all the rust buckets that were worthless over there. i recall a company in belgium that would slap-dash weld a few panels and goop the car up with undercoating and send 'em over here. we even got boatloads of benzes that had been sunk in a ship carrier disaster...hundreds of them.....

those coupes are an acquired taste...the manual shifters are simply awful (floor shift) and the cars are heavy and slow. hp to weight ratio can't be very good."
912,"September 23, 2005 11:09AM",andre1969,"i do kinda like the style of those old benz hardtops. if i ever got daring enough to play around with an old import, i wouldn't mind having one. so are they really any more complicated than a fintail sedan? also, did the hardtop model ever come with fins on it?"
913,"September 23, 2005 11:50AM",fintail,"the coupes are very elegant cars, and if you can find one with immaculate leather and wood, they have lovely interiors.

i don't know if performance is so awful...an injected fintail is a decent performer for the time, and is fully competent in modern traffic. late ones like mine put out about 140hp, which is adequate. they don't accelerate fast from a stop due to 2nd gear start, but they handle very well and cruise along at 60mph wonderfully. i don't know if a coupe was much different. the injected sedans were extremely successful in racing during the early 60s, and their 1-2-3 at monte carlo in 1960 is still amazing.

mechanically, the coupes are identical to an injected fintail, although i am pretty sure they are heavier, and they have a lot more detailed interior trim.. there was a 300se coupe with air suspension and a complex engine, one should stay away from those unless they love the cars.

no fins on coupes, save for the small bumps seen on all cars/"
914,"September 23, 2005 1:46PM",Mr_Shiftright,"book says 0-60 in 13 seconds and fuel consumption of 13.7 mpg. it's actually faster than a 220se sedan even though it's 200 lbs heavier. all these 60s benzes are not exactly ballerinas or very agile, but for their time they handle better than their american contemporaries."
915,"September 23, 2005 1:53PM",fintail,"13.7mpg??? which book is this? i can get 23mpg or so on the highway in my car, and i think 0-60 is around 11 sec or so. i never get below maybe 15-18mpg in town. i'll need to find my factory spec book when i get home."
916,"September 23, 2005 2:52PM",Mr_Shiftright,"no, 13.7 is for the coupe. they are notorious gas guzzlers. i bet with radar your car would be about 13 secs if you did a couple of two-way runs and averaged them...that's about right for the power and weight. but you might be a tad quicker with an automatic trans and aggressive shifting."
917,"September 24, 2005 10:52AM",fintail,"here's the fintail's consumption per the owners manual. i originally scanned this for the hilarious oil consumption. what does that number mean? is that max permissible or something? it doesn't use *that* much oil.



must be something wrong with it, it's being relisted. looks like a cute thing

strange to see a new subaru in this condition. oh wait...

someone doesn't understand ""brougham"", but not many nice ones of these left. the eldo wore the body better imo

not many of these still roadworthy"
918,"September 24, 2005 11:42AM",Mr_Shiftright,"heck i'd buy that saab if it still had a transmission that worked. tough old cars but trans is a real weakness and painfully expensive to repair. fair price. i love the clunky column shifter and v-4s are so weird.

mg midget --- does seem a tad cheap but it's no mgb...but if it's a mite shabby here and there but runs okay, price is about right. pebble beach midget is worth maybe $5,000.

nice old xj6 but in the us of a he is a bit delirous at $4,800 for these old barges. you could hardly buy a worse car, but they are purty so someone will overpay for it and live in hell for a while. this car would sell for double in the uk if it were rhd. $3,500 would be about right and figure a quick $1,000 in surprises after that. not a bad sunday drive take the kids for ice cream don't go far on a hot day car.

toronado seller is nuts at that price. wake up and take $2,500 and be happy. 1980s cars are sold mostly by the pound."

maybe because the color reminds me of this beast"
920,"September 24, 2005 12:10PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well if you could put the driveline of the benz into the body of the jaguar you might have a car that everyone could like. oh, the german electrics and cooling system, too--except the radio! and of course american a/c.

if anyone out there wants an xj6, get an 85-86; otherwise you'll be real sorry."
921,"September 24, 2005 4:56PM",fintail,"hey the old becker europa works well enough for a single speaker unit.

i'm happy with the german body too. although old mbs rust, nothing rusts like a vintage brit."
922,"September 24, 2005 5:26PM",Mr_Shiftright,"it's the fins...i have nightmares about fins, where i'm a little child and virgil exner is trying to kidnap me and take me to his fin castle....

well i'm presuming we'll pick a good xj6 body. okay, you can keep the becker if you must....probably better than the hand-cranked am radio in the jaguar anyway.

now that rolls and bentley are owned by the germans, my proposal is no longer heresy."
923,"September 25, 2005 11:39AM",fintail,"in the 60s i think beckers were high tech. sure the 80s ones are silly, but the old ones are good.

i've never had an aversion to fins, but then again, they have always seemed vintage to me, as i didn't grow up when they signified the excess of the domestics.

a cheap way to get into this club...not saying i want to be a member"
924,"September 25, 2005 12:31PM",Mr_Shiftright,"$2,000 is more than enough i think. scary car to drive. i remember bounding down the highway getting seasick while watching that massive hood oilcan in and out and make kaplunk noises. what a thrill....no wonder benz rolled right over them.

i wouldn't mind a really cheap '93 or so cadillac coupe with the northstar....they drive pretty decently for the type."
925,"September 25, 2005 12:41PM",british_rover,"this thread is going to be my bane i can just feel it. now i have a hundred some people looking around for project cars for me.

y'know though, i must be getting more tolerant in my old age or something, because starched up cars used to either hurt my eyes, make me shake my head in disgust, or laugh. but now i don't even notice them anymore, like i've been numbed or something.

maybe they're the automotive equivalent of a murder or something? y'know, where the first time you see someone get killed, it really freaks you out, but then if you see it again, your senses become dulled to it? umm, not that i'm speaking from experience! :shades:"
928,"September 26, 2005 5:05AM",andre1969,"i've always had a strange sort of fetish for them, especially the '75-76 convertibles. there's just something about the rectangular quad headlights and bulkier bumpers that i think works on these cars, somehow, and makes them more attractive to me than the '71-74 counterparts. still, when it comes to these big 70's convertibles, maybe i'm just too conservative, because i find myself liking the big chevies and lesabres better. especially something like a '72 impala or a '75 lesabre."
929,"September 26, 2005 5:34AM",lemko,"there are a lot of 1975-76 cadillac eldorado survivors and many in much better shape than the black one above. i'd say big '70s eldos were the majority of cars at our fall meet this past sunday. i prefer the trimmer 1967-70 eldos myself, especially the 1969-70 models. the concealed headlamps on the 1967-68s make them seem too much like lincolns. the 1976 model was the last to feature the big 500 cid v-8. the 1977-78 eldorados have the 425 v-8.

there were also several allantes. the last 1993 model is the best as it has a decent powertrain to go with that beautiful pininfarina body."
930,"September 26, 2005 8:23AM",Mr_Shiftright,"many people saved 75-76 eldos because they thought they'd be the last gm convertibles...much to their future dismay. then when they found out that they weren't going to be big buck collectibles, they all tried to sell them at the same time...result? glutted market we see today.

i agree with you, the late 60s eldos are a much nicer car in every way."
931,"September 26, 2005 8:29AM",andre1969,"that the late 60's eldorado truly is a thing of beauty, although i prefer the ones with the hidden headlights. still, there's just some sort of garish charm that attracts me to those big '75-76 convertibles!

too bad they didn't make a convertible version of the '71-78 toronado...i actually prefer it to the eldorado."

has the ""smoky and the bandit"" generation started upping the value of these yet? i think the seats are upholstered that way, not just covers."
934,"September 26, 2005 8:59AM",Mr_Shiftright,"nah, late 70s cars are doomed. they'll never be worth anything unless you maybe gut them and clone them and customize them.

zimmer: everytime i see one, my mouth goes agape wondering what the hell would motivate anyone to buy one of these. it's so wrong in every way. it's the equivalent of wearing a ladies flower hat, a pirate's eye patch, a civil war shirt and clown pants and telling everyone you're a victorian gentleman. what a mess of styles, pretense and bad taste!"
935,"September 26, 2005 9:01AM",andre1969,"had a 1963 mercury monterrey with that ""breezeway"" rear window. granddad liked it because it enabled him to haul long stuff like lumber, ladders, etc in the car. kind of like a pre-historic avalanche, i guess! every once in awhile, i'll see one at a car show. their loving owners are usually not amused when i tell them about how granddad used to use his! :p

actually, in 2-door hardtop and convertible form, '63 mercurys aren't bad looking cars. the 4-doors are pretty awkward looking though, because of those over-sized roofs.

as for that trans am, i've always liked that style, with the quad headlights. i didn't care for them when they went to the style with the headlights above the low-mounted grille, which i think was 1979-81? my cousin had a trans am like that back in the 80's."
936,"September 26, 2005 9:04AM",andre1969,"was used as the basis for that zimmer? i thought that most of those ""neoclassic"" styles used the '83-86 cougar, but that one looks like it might use a mid-80's crown vic/grand marquis coupe as its basis. one of my relatives used to have a tiffany, which i'm pretty sure was based on the cougar. fortunately, i never had the honor of seeing it!"

when there's a glimmer in his eye,
his golden spirit is nearby,
and you will hear the people cry:
""it's a zimmer!
...by zimmer!""

for it's zimmer, the man, who makes zimmer, the car;
a work of art (by art)
that stands so smart!

yes, it's zimmer, the man, who makes zimmer, the car;
a work of art (by art)
that stands apart!

so follow the excitement, when you hear it!
and before you know it, you'll be near it,
then you can feast your eyes
on the sweet, shining prize
that's art zimmer's golden spirit!"

943,"September 26, 2005 9:53AM",andre1969,"as far as collectibility goes, but that '79 fairmont, with the 302 v-8, is probably a very rare beast. the vast majority of these only had 200 inlline-6es, or even the 2.3 pinto 4. there was also a 4.2/255 version of the 302 available, that might've had around 112 hp. while the fairmont was about the size of a downsized intermediate (and in fact, would ultimately the fox platform would serve as ford's intermediate) the fairmont was generally considered a compact, and as a result mainly got stuck with the smaller engines.

if nothing else, they were pretty lightweight, so i'd imagine a 140 hp 302 in a car that light wouldn't be a bad performer. also, for some reason, it seems like the fairmont and the mustang got the higher-output 140 hp 302, while the bigger cars, iirc, got stuck with the 129 hp version of the 302. :confuse:"

of course, he has plans for a full restoration. he thinks he can do it for around $2-3,000.

he must live in some alternate universe. he always talks about how it will just fly down the highway. people always assume it is slow because it is diesel, but according to him once you are on the interstate it can catch and pass almost anything on the road.

his daily driver is a mid-late 80s cutlass ciera with a 4 cylinder with over 205,000 miles last i heard. he thinks all gm 80s products are as reliable as new toyotas. he also claimed that his wife's 2000 saturn was a far superior auto to my wife's 2000 bmw for less than half the cost.

i know this is only tangentially related to autos, but i can't complain to my wife about it. alternate universe, i tell you."

originally, there was supposed to be a turbo 2.3 offered for the fairmont, but only a few prototypes were built, and it never made it to the mass market."
956,"September 26, 2005 11:10AM",fintail,"that guy is insane. as that ad shows, you can get a mint old diesel for just a few grand, so restoring one is either for the overly sentimental or the ignorant. he'd be much better off to buy a nice original car needing little, and use his old jalopy as a parts car.

once it reaches highway speeds, in what seems like hours from the green light, it will keep up with traffic. but speed gains are not quick.

as i owned a new 1979 fairmont station wagon with the 200 cid inline 6 with the 3-speed auto, i remember the car was a terrible cold starter in winter. anything below 10 degrees f., you could almost forget about it. needless to say, the autolite carb was choked down by 1979-technology emission controls. ford could have done much better. plus, i was consistently replacing the exhaust donut connecting the manifold to the headpipe. other than that, and eventually having practically all the hydraulic lifters fail at around 100k, it was a reliable engine. only other replacements included a water pump and starter. oil changes were at 3k or 3 months intervals since purchase, and it never burned any oil, even when i sold it to my brother-in-law for $1 (yep, that's right) in 1989."

remember, the chassis was essentially the same as the mustang of the day (making it the spiritual successor to the falcon). it was also pretty like, so the v8 gave it snappy performance (for the day at least).

of course, you would then have a tacky looking, unloved car with an at (which should oncly come in 5 speed), plus you would have about 2-3x it's worth invested.

corvair turbo --- ""no rust"" but needs the trunk floor welded in? these ""turbos"" only work at very high rpm---the turbo system is extremely primitive and the carburator is mid stream between turbo and intake. not the best idea.

jensen healey -- can be made into a decent car with some modifications but will probably never be worth very much. faster than an mgb, too. by a good margin.

another thing i'm starting to wonder, is if people have forgotten what vinyl is? i notice the ad says that lecar has a leather interior?! :confuse: i've been seeing that a lot lately in old car ads, where a vinyl interior gets listed as ""leather"""

still paid too much for it though. one sale isn't the market by a long shot. exceptional car, exceptional price, foolish purchase imo. buyer paid 100% over retail but....if he's happy, then he's happy.

i think $4,600 is dead on for a clean 100k mile 560sec, 1987 and for a stunning 1990 low miles, $10,000 is all the money in the world and beyond.

i agree, $2,200 sounds suspiciously cheap, but if it had like bad ac or a couple rips in the interior or a funny noise somewhere, then $2,200 is more than enough.

these cars can suck up money so fast they'll make your socks roll up and down. remember you are talking about $16,000 engine rebuilds."

like in mopars, if a wedgie is better than a hemi for anything short of professional drag racing, why is the price differential so huge?

i suspect if it is up to gen x to support car values in future years, the muscle car market is in a very tenuous position."
998,"September 27, 2005 12:23PM",andre1969,"with those old novas, i think the only ones that are really worth anything are the ss396 models, and the handful of yenko novas that were made. otherwise, there's just not much there. hardtops and convertible body styles were jettisoned with the 1968 restyle, leaving just a 2- and 4-door sedan. most of them were just 6-cylinder models or tame 307's. fwiw, in stock form the 307-2bbl had 200 hp gross/130 net, so it wasn't much of a step up from a 6-cyl. they could be pretty decent with a 350, though.

on the plus side, i think the '68+ is a sturdier design than the '62-67, so it can probably accommodate a larger, more powerful engine more easily. personally, i always liked the '75-79 ""european"" nova, as it was coined, although i think the enthusiasts tend to prefer the '68-74 style.

still, that $4200 nova doesn't seem like a bad car."
999,"September 27, 2005 12:58PM",Mr_Shiftright,"the short answer is it's all about engine size and vin plate authenticity.

if it's got a rare huge engine and a correct vin plate and was built between 1964-1972, it's probably worth some money. all the rest are just used cars."

that car is worth maybe $500 if it's been underwater. you've got an engine core (the cases), maye a used crankshaft and some sheet metal....that's it. this is salt water remember (or brackish)."
1005,"September 27, 2005 7:55PM",Mr_Shiftright,"hmmmm....that porsche 928 is exactly like my car! value? if it's beautiful, maybe $4,500--$6,000 tops. you can buy much newer 928s with the better transmission and 4 cams for $9999.

70 cougar -- if the car is really nice, yeah, it's worth $8,000 because of the 351 engine. but if it's in any way raggedy-[non-permissible content removed], the lower retail value he posted is more like it. $8k is an ""excellent"" grade.

72 impala -- hmmm...wrong engine, that's bad, so it's more like a street rod type car....if it were a very sharp stock 454, that could bring his price but as is, i'd have to say $7,500 is all the money, maybe $8,500 for the sounds, wheels, etc. any more than that, and you're buried.

280sel -- kind of a nothing car...parts missing, ratty interior...well, maybe $1,500 is fair enough

54 chevy -- could easily be worth the money if it runs well and you don't mind going about 45 mph in a 3/4 ton washing machine. best thing to do with this is put a regular pickup bed on it and slap some seat covers and rubber mats in 'er, and you'd come out with a small profit i think.

450slc -- if it's a sharp car, price is quite fair, a slight bargain. i'm surprised, this dealer is right on with this price and way off with the porsche 928....he should reallly raise the price on the 450slc to $6,500 and knock it off the 928 and he'd sell both cars faster."

1011,"September 28, 2005 8:58AM",jaserb,"""(is there any worse year for cars than 1974?)""

hey, now. '74 was actually ok - the really onerous bumper and emissions requirements were still a year or two away. i think the mgb did switch to rubber bumpers that year, but the alfas and datsun z cars still had nice chrome bumpers. emissions hadn't quite killed off the big block muscle cars yet - you could still get an sd 455 firebird or a 454 corvette. '74 is actually considered a very good year for alfas - it's the last year for the bertone gtv and the chrome bumper spiders. the fuel injection system on the alfas was clean enough that they didn't need a cat or smog pump or anything. out of the box the '73 and '74 alfas are the quickest mainstream cars alfa ever sold here in the us.

so while by and large things were going downhill in '74 there were still some bright spots. i don't think you can say the same about, say, '78. maybe the release of the mustang ii was enough to overshadow all that, though...

1012,"September 28, 2005 9:36AM",jrosasmc,the mgb and midget both went to the rubber bumpers and smog-choked engines in 1975. and speaking of alfas i was once told by a reputable alfa master technician that one must avoid the 80-81 models because the spica systems were so terrible that year.
1013,"September 28, 2005 9:40AM",Mr_Shiftright,"nonsense...spica is a good system if you know how to set it up.....it's like su carbs, only fearful to the unknowing.

and this is at the other end of the spectrum, so to speak"
1019,"September 28, 2005 9:55AM",jaserb,"actually, he's right about the '80 and '81 cars. by that time the regulations had been tightened enough that the spica mechanical injection system had reached the end of its useful lifespan. to pass the regulations in '80 and '81 alfa used a ""monofarfalle"" intake that had only a single butterfly valve instead of individual valves for each cylinder and generally choked the engine to within an inch of its life. ruined the reliability, gas mileage, drivability, etc. these cars you can make a very good case for scrapping the spica and going to webers, or at least an earlier spica system. it's kind of similar to the '73-'74 z cars - the only way to fix the carbs is to chuck them and install proper sus from a '70-72 model.

in '82 alfa switched to bosch elecronic fi, which was much more reliable and emissions friendly, even if it did lack the performance and tunability of the spica system.

i think this is the classic project car (if you happen to want one in nice shape). beat up enough that you will get buried financially (or time wise) restoring it (that is, put in more than it is worth). but, it is in just good enough condition (eems complete) that you can talk yourself into taking it on (just a little body work some paint,...).

'56 packard -- better than a '55, price is okay i think, you have a little room there, maybe $4,000 to spend before you are upside down.

at least (in today's muscle car crazy times), a clean mach 1 4 speed has some value. maybe not as much as a 428cj, but at least if you spend a bundle making it perfect, it won't be a $3,500 car anyway.

now, i like the cortina, even if it isn't the version with the curvy hips. the at eliminates it for me though. if it was a stick, and as solid as presented, i would buy it for $500 just to have smoething fairly simple to play with (hench, making it my project). clean it up, and make some upgrades to trun it into a perios ""hot rod"" car.

maybe they flamed because of the heater. this model burned gasoline in a little furnace to heat the car, rather than using the engine heat. of course, in a cold climate those air cooled models didn't generate a lot of engine heat.

that '72 sedan deville is pretty sweet, though. i really like that color!"
1074,"September 30, 2005 11:00AM",Mr_Shiftright,"no they aren't. it's a dealer and he's trolling for suckers. he's about $8,000 over high retail, so don't ask me what he's smokin'."

1076,"September 30, 2005 11:42AM",andre1969,"and it looks like the sj was the mid-level grand prix that year, and considered the sporty version. i'd guess that the rally wheels would have been standard then, but it's possible that over the years they might have been swapped off that particular example. also, the sj came standard with a 400-4bbl. sadly, as impressive as that might sound, it only had 185 hp, just 25 more than the 350-2bbl that was standard in the base gp. kinda pathetic that an extra two barrels and 50 more cubes would only get you 25 more hp. but then even the top 455-4bbl only got you up to 205 hp that year. :blush:"
1077,"September 30, 2005 11:47AM",fintail,"i wouldn't doubt they were swapped, people like those rally wheels. were those ""lace"" wheels similar to what is sometimes on a firebird offered on a gp? i swear i've seen it before.

those engine outputs are sad, seeing as my mere 2195cc fintail puts out 140hp. of course, no emissions controls on it."
1078,"September 30, 2005 11:57AM",stickguy,"certainly looks to be worth finishing. souldn't take too much to get it looking ready for the cruise in. now the price seems a tad high, since it still needs body work and paint, but probably not too much given all the mechanical work just done.

however, there was also a snowflake rally and a honeycomb rally

i'm not sure what year those other rally wheels came out, but they may have been available in '76. and i know i've seen them on '77 grand prixs and downsized grand prixes and lemanses, so they were offered on cars other than the firebird/ta."

1083,"September 30, 2005 1:30PM",rorr,"""people forget that they make a lot of corvettes every year.""

which reminds me - has anyone been watching any of the jackson barret highlights lately on speed channel? last night, i saw a pair of corvettes being auctioned: a beautifully restored (over restored?) '53 vette (white w/ red interior) and a matching 50th anniversary '03 vette (white w/ red interior) which the owner of the '53 had worked out with gm that the '03 would come down the line with the same last 5 digits in the vin number as his '53.

i think the pair of cars went for the absolutely insane price of $500k. as far as i could tell, the biggest draw was the fact that the vin numbers for the two essentially matched.

and the other jaw-dropper of the night was the guy who spent $3m (yes, that's 3 million dollars) on the last olds f88 concept car from the early 50's.

okay - it's a one of a kind. but what the heck makes it any more significant than any number of other 'one of a kind' concept cars built in the '50s?????? three million bucks?

i don't get it."
1084,"September 30, 2005 3:13PM",Mr_Shiftright,"most of those high bidders take a beating a few months later, but the concept car is ""one of a kind"" so all you need is two people with money who want it, and the race is on!!

as for the ""matching vettes""----i don't get it either. the roadster if we allow every possible amount for it might be worth $175,000 and the '93 vette is just a used car....so i don't know what to say about this....drunk maybe?"
1085,"September 30, 2005 3:29PM",xwesx,"a fella in washington used to store his cars in my dad's quanset hut when i was growing up. he had a pair of ss el caminos in there for about 6 years. one of them was a '69 (midnight blue) and i think the other was a '70 or '71(dark green), but i cannot remember which. he had them tricked out with alloy wheels, custom steering wheels, and the engines were covered in chrome everything (not sure why someone would really want to have chrome parts on their engine, but to each their own!). the most memorable thing for me was that the fuel lines were transparent. for some reason i always found that intriguing..... anyway, they were amazing machines and could really get up and go!

in addition to those, the other one i remember as quite a beauty was a..... i might be wrong on the year here..... 1956 volvo. i think it was a coupe (sheesh, i should remember that better!). it was painted black and had tinted windows that were so dark you couldn't even see into the car. i never had the opportunity to ride in that one or even look inside it, but it was sure easy on the eyes."
1086,"September 30, 2005 5:31PM",ghulet,"....this price doesn't seem to jibe with the car; if it's half as nice as it looks in the pictures, this is an aggressive price. then again, getting rid of a land yacht like this in october in chicago, with $3.20 a gallon gas, apparently isn't easy; this has been on craigslist for at least a week, listed several times. the complete lack of a real description (no list of options, body condition, what works and what doesn't, etc.) should worry anyone (and what's a '305' engine doing in this big ol' thang?). i love vague declarations like 'run good' on a forty year-old car, as if that's the only thing to worry about.

and for the price i really like that '70 lesabre! heck, i'd even take it with the dented fender! i'm guessing that ""350 hp"" really just means it has a 350 v-8?"
1096,"October 3, 2005 8:43AM",andre1969,"there were some pics to go along with this. for $325 though, i guess you shouldn't expect much!

i remember back in the late 80's, looking through the used car ads i came upon a dealership near the dc border that had a 1977 lemans listed for $195. also had a 1977 catalina for $295 and a 1978 catalina for $695. i was shocked that they had that many pontiacs of that vintage (and that i liked!) well, i drove by there one day, and the lemans wasn't there. the $295 catalina was, though. boy, what a wreck! it had some pretty major body damage, and while it ran, the whole under-hood area was greasy and oily, like everything that could leak, did leak! the interior was pretty torn up and greasy too, like maybe a mechanic used the car to make runs to the junkyard or something. if the $295 car looked that bad though, i'd hate to think what the $195 one looked like! as i recall, the $695 one wasn't too bad, though.

this little dealership occasionally got interesting, but junky cars, but ultimately went out of business. it's just a parking lot now, and they store buses on it."

1106,"October 4, 2005 7:39AM",stickguy,"that stag, i don't even know what to say, but the engine swap might even increase it's value! too bad they didn't go with a manual tranny. but, i wouldn't touch it.

the nova, same as the mustang (good bones for a hot rod project), except the 4 doors let that option go.

if you like this type of beast, get the ranchero cheap (engine knock? not good), and drop in a nice crate big block and have something unique.

the cutlass looks like a good bomber for a high school kid, but i wouldn't want it as a project, since i think it will have a lot more problems as you start to dig into it, and rust never sleeps."

what's not to love? it takes the worst feature of the car (well, other than the styling) and replaces it with one of the best engines ever made. also way overpowering the chassis, which should be loads of fun.

heck, i would buy it (at least for the price it is at, or up to ~1k) just for the novelty, even though it is a nasty color.

i actually do like tr7 convertibles, so that's a plus.

i read the questions, and it sounds like the engine might be hinky (not a real nissan turbo set up), so it is likely to grenade at any time, but fun in the meantime.

i wouldn't use it as a hi mile daily driver, but for a weekend toy (1-2k a year), it's viable.

now, if i was doing it, i would have stuck in a mazda rotary. at least it would have fit better, and their might even be a kit for it."

best rx-7 you could buy is one with a blown engine and otherwise beautiful for $100----then you put in a new or rebult crate engine from mazdatrix or one of those guys. this way you are starting off right with the engine and you can take care of it as mazda required."

1122,"October 5, 2005 6:11AM",lemmer,"i had an '84 rx-7. it ran perfectly for a year, then had complete and total failure at just under 90,000 probably from lack of proper care from the previous owner. what stunk is that there was no warning - no loss of power, no smoke, no nothing.

this was in 1992. i had no money to repair it so i put in the penny saver listed at $1000. by the end of the first day, my answering machine was full of messages and i already had $1000 in cash in my hand. it was a base model that had some body damage and an interior that was average at best.

first and second generation rx-7s were very reliable other than the engine, and the engine usually only failed early due to poor care by the owner. the third generation cars were a little different - a ton more power and an expected engine life of maybe 75,000 miles if you babied it."

umm, i had one of these ""spirited"" v-6es in an '82 cutlass supreme, a car that weighs around 200-300 less than that ventura. however, my '82 probably had much taller gearing. still, you'd probably be better off with a chevy 305. much better performance, and probably not much of a fuel economy hit.

at the swap meet at carlisle this past weekend, an awful lot of the smaller-engined cars for sale seemed to have ""economical"" ""great mileage"" ""25 mpg"" etc posted in their windows. and the seller of a '77 electra i was looking at commented on how the 403 is very economical. umm, right. maybe compared to a '76 with a 455! :p"

jaguar xj6 -- a ten year old jaguar with 150,000++ miles on it? why not save yourself the time and trouble and just stick your head into a wood chipper? over-priced. it's a $3,500 car all day long because you can be sure it's going to start feeding on you right after you drive it away. it'll be a $6,000 car in a couple of months anyway.

rx-7: yep, that's right. with good care, you can get 150k out of a rotary engine. but if you overheat it, just once, even for just a minute, your engine is toast, and doomed to failure. also, neber eber use synthetic oil in a rotary engine, as per dire warnings from mazdatrix.com, who oughta know."
1142,"October 5, 2005 10:51AM",fintail,"well, it is rarer than a 2002 camry, and i am sure someone somewhere is seeking one...of course they are probably in sapporo or liverpool or something.

i don't know if the 280 is a c or ce. a carb car might put out maybe 130-140hp, maybe 150-160hp for the fi car. the fi engine is better in about every way."
1143,"October 5, 2005 11:05AM",lemmer,"what is the shifty verdict on that 6 series bmw in post 1290? was that a good year for them.

by the way, i looked in ""excellence"" regarding 968s. they say a '92 coupe in poor condition is worth over $10,000. that makes that '94 in decent condition look cheap at $9,999 - ""excellence"" puts an average '94 at around $14,500, but this one in particular was kind of high mileage."
1144,"October 5, 2005 11:09AM",lemko,"i came across a very attractive 1968 cadillac sedan deville this week parked outside a repair shop near my workplace. it is white without a vinyl top and a black brocade and leather interior. the car appears to be a very well-preserved unrestored original with 34k miles on it. the paint is nearly flawless and the chrome is equally nice. the guy wants $8,500 for it which i think is steep for a sedan regardless of how nice it is. is $8,500 fair for this car, too much, or a bargain. what would a fair price be?"
1145,"October 5, 2005 11:49AM",andre1969,"just as a rough reference point, grbeck and i saw a pretty nice '69 sedan deville at carlisle. they were asking $5,000, iirc. i remember grbeck saying that if you could talk them down to $3,000 that it would be a pretty good deal. this one was green with a green brocade/leather interior. i dunno how much the green would kill the value of it, compared to a white one. personally, i love green, but for the most part i think cars get deducted for it. unless you're talking about a jag in period correct british racing green or something like that!

i'd imagine that $8500 would be kind of high, unless it's almost flawless."
1146,"October 5, 2005 11:53AM",stickguy,"seems to have well preserved older cars too. i need to get out of the northeast (aka the rustbelt).

i actually like that '76 nova ss. nothing a new lock cylinder won't cure. for the money, if it is sound, you could make a nice project out of it. at least the parts are cheap."
1147,"October 5, 2005 11:55AM",Mr_Shiftright,"""excellence"" is an excellent magazine but a lousy price guide. you can never trust what we call an ""interested' party. a '92 968 in poor condition is $5,000 at the very most, so you can see how far they are off----100% inflation! as for their 1994 pricing, as we say in the business ""only in your dreams"". of course, if it were an exceptional, highly modified, one owner, pristine, low miles time capsule, well....maybe $12,500. they must be reading too many of their clients' asking prices. i mean, they value my 1980 porsche 928 at about twice what it's worth and twice what i paid for it. not likely!

bmw 6 series --- i like these cars a lot but the miles on the one being offered are very very high, and the car has been monkeyed with, and really, they aren't all that ""collectible"". the market for 6 series coupes has never been very strong. you should be able to buy a very sharp, ready to go, no problems 635 csi for $6,000."
1148,"October 5, 2005 11:59AM",andre1969,"i like that one, too....always did like that style, which, while dated today, sure seemed modern at the time! especially when you put it up against the likes of the granada, maverick, volare, dart/valiant, etc. almost looks too clean and sleek and uncluttered to be a mid-70's car!"
1149,"October 5, 2005 12:02PM",lemmer,that sounds like convertible money. i can't imagine it is worth that much. unless of course it is worth that much to you. it is only the price of a slightly used kia. how wrong could you go?

....i know these were (originally) much maligned (i think more so than its contemporary, the 320i) for some mechanical problem (warping cylinder heads? i can't remember), and for being fuelish. were their inherent problems likely repaired when the car was much younger, or is it a lifelong thing? i know the subsequent 528i was a much better car all around. this at least gets points for being one of the first real 'sports sedans'. anyway, looks damn clean for an almost 30 year-old car, has had lots of recent maintenance, so at $1100, seems fair enough to me, at least as a second car."
1155,"October 5, 2005 3:06PM",Mr_Shiftright,"sure why not at that price? if the head cracks, just junk it. i sure wouldn't invest anything in it cosmetically or mechanically though.

i looked at a mid-90's 530 at one point (about 4-5 years ago) and remember digging into this stuff. you needed to do a cylinder leak down test to know for sure if it was bad.

i think the type of gas used contributed to the problem."
1167,"October 6, 2005 8:46AM",lemmer,"still thinking about 968s since you made me realize that they are more affordable than i thought. i looked up pricing in a couple of places and found the following.

1993 porsche 968

edmunds - $ 8,379
kbb - $8,840
sports car market - $14,000 to $19,500

maybe the key is buy one from a used car dealer, rather than a private party or specialty dealer who is more likely to seek an scm or excellence value."

1169,"October 6, 2005 11:17AM",Mr_Shiftright,oops! sports car market goofed bigtime on that one. i'll write and tell them. totally wrong.
1170,"October 6, 2005 11:36AM",bumpy,"on that local corvair coupe. no windshield wipers, no horn button, some rust bubbles around the rear windows, a double-quarter-sized chunk missing in the rear quarter panel, some broken tailight lenses, and general signs that it had been sitting neglected for most of the last 20 years. it had a ""140"" badge on the trunklid, which i believe makes it a high-output version of the flat 6 with four(!) single-barrel carbs. still, it's a project car at best and not street-legal as is (and no floor shifter, hence a nonstandard powerglide 2-speed slushbox), so pass."
1171,"October 6, 2005 11:43AM",andre1969,"for the price i really like that '76 pimp deville! if it were closer i'd be tempted, but as it stands it would probably cost at least the selling price in fuel to drive it back here!"
1172,"October 6, 2005 11:57AM",lemko,...that 1976 coupe deville is pretty close to stock. i'd check this one closely for rust as that price is suspiciously cheap. looks like it needs tires and they aren't cheap on this big ride.
1173,"October 6, 2005 12:04PM",Mr_Shiftright,"if that '76 were clean in and out, should be worth $2,500. we always wonder what ""tlc"" means however."
1174,"October 6, 2005 12:07PM",stickguy,"on ebay, i think it means transmission likely crappy..

or maybe too little compression, take your pick."
1175,"October 6, 2005 12:08PM",stickguy,"to me, it should me basic stuff (detail in/out, maybe breaks/tires/full tune up, and a few non-essential odds and ends to patch up.

1177,"October 6, 2005 12:10PM",andre1969,"that deville would take a 235/75/r15 tire as standard. if you shop around, you can probably get 'em for about $50 per tire off tirerack.com or someplace like that, and get a local shop to mount and balance 'em for $50-60 total."
1178,"October 6, 2005 12:14PM",andre1969,"it wouldn't be my first choice in an old caddy either, but hey, for that price, if there's nothing major wrong with it, there's still enough there for me to like. in fact, there's a lot there to like! something like what? 233 inches? :p

when it comes to these mammoth old cruisers though, i actually prefer the oldsmobiles and especially the buicks. and with the big c-bodies i prefer the 4-doors, after they started going opera-window with the coupes. give me a nice '76 electra hardtop sedan in a light metallic blue and i'll absolutely drool! :shades:"
1179,"October 6, 2005 12:52PM",xwesx,"hahahahhaha! that car looks identical to one my grandmother owned and kept in oregon for her real estate trips there. she eventually instructed my mother to sell it for her, but then the ""buyer"" never paid her (and therefore never received the title) and it was sold twice after that from the first ""buyer"" to another then another. she finally tracked the car down about 3 years later and asked my dad to go and repossess it from the guy who currently ""owned"" it. he/we did, and we loaded it up on his 18' flatbed trailer. the beast sat there for a few months, but it was more or less trashed via the three ""owners"" that tossed it about for those three years. my grandmother gave it to me, and i was going to work on it, but my dad said, ""what you have there is a $50 car that gets 6 mpg. if you work on it, you're going to have a $50 car that you spent $5000 on and it will still get 6 mpg.""

we took it to a recycling place and they gave us $50 for it. it had a monstrous engine in it though.... did cadillac put a 500 in them that year? it made the 305/350 block look like a little baby engine."
1180,"October 6, 2005 1:03PM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah, but as they say in texas, that engine was ""big hat, no cattle""."
1181,"October 6, 2005 1:15PM",lemmer,"i have my limits with fuel economy. unless it is a race car, i don't think i could own anything that got less than maybe 12 mpg, even if it was just a weekend car."
1182,"October 6, 2005 1:32PM",andre1969,"would something like that '76 only get like 6 mpg?! that just sounds astounding to me, but i guess i can see it. after all, cars like my '76 lemans 350, '79 new yorker 360, and '67 catalina 400 only get around 10 mpg around town. and that '76 would probably have a half-ton on my catalina, and more on the other two!

i think my buddy with the '78 mark v 460 says he gets around 14-15 on the highway.

consumer reports tested an early 70's electra with the 455 once. i think it was a '73. i want to say hp was around 230 by that time, which was sad, but it would get worse. i think it did 0-60 in about 12.5 seconds. i'd imagine the caddy would be about the same? just to show you how quick it got bad though, they also tested a '71 or so impala or caprice with a 454, and it did 0-60 in around 8.7 seconds! i'm sure it would've weighed about 500-600 lb or so less than the electra, though."
1183,"October 6, 2005 2:35PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well do the math....a 5,025 lb car, shaped like a cinder block, powered by a 500 cid engine putting out 190 hp coupled to a three-speed automatic. that's a 26.5 :1 weight to power ratio---not good. i'm sure a new caddy is about half that ratio."
1184,"October 6, 2005 3:14PM",xwesx,"haha.... that's an absolutely apt description. i am guessing that the mpg was a bit better than 6 if the car was in mechanically sound condition. after all, both of the exhaust manifolds were cracked on this one and you had to add fuel or starting fluid to the carb directly in order to start it. the guy from whom we repossessed the car had ""inserted"" a screwdriver into the ignition core with a 2# sledge because he lost his key... so this was not a well maintained car. have you ever watched the red green show? :p

friend of mine had a '69 eldorado with a.... hmm. i'm bad at these engine displacements. 454? big. but the big difference between this car and the deville (other than the much more appealing look of the eldorado) was that this car hauled [non-permissible content removed]. i had to drive it one time for him (he owned a car, but didn't know how to drive it!) to get it to a shop, and i was momentarily expecting an old boat like my '69 econoline (daily driver at that point). i punched the gas to enter the main drag, and the darned thing burned a heck of a lot of rubber, but didn't get too far. i had to drive it very gingerly because while it would really take off, it still drove like a slushy old caddy...."
1185,"October 6, 2005 3:18PM",andre1969,"here's this one doesn't seem too bad and heck, the price is only $225 more than i paid for mine 11 years ago! can't tell too much from the pics, but that's not the right interior pattern. and no a/c. on my screen i can't tell if it's white or a really sickly pale blue. and i have no idea what those hubcaps came off of. still, i guess you could do worse. funny though, as much as i normally go crazy over the big '67 pontiacs, this one's just not doing it for me. i wonder if it's just the color?"
1186,"October 6, 2005 3:22PM",andre1969,"iirc, the '69 eldorado had a 472. they were still heavy cars, but it probably weighed about 400 lb or so less than the '76 i guess. also, back then the engines weren't strangled down, so that 472 probably had something like 375 hp gross, which is probably around 280-300 net. they also started gearing them really taller by the mid 70's, so i'm sure a '69 eldo probably had a quicker axle ratio."

that monte is cool too...i didn't even know they offered a turbo in 1981! i thought 1980 was the only year for it. fwiw though, this 3.8 is a different beast from the one that later went in the grand national. this 1981 only has around 165-170 hp, and is the older, more fragile block that had all the lubrication issues. the 3.8 got a new, much stronger block for 1985 that eliminated most of the lubrication problems, and by that time hp was up into the 220-230 range. still would be a cool car, though."

maybe so, maybe not, but given that you have to pull the engine cases apart to fix this problem, well, then you are into a major rebuild, well, then you are in $10,000 bucks.

a leakdown test and a flashlight under there would work wonders for my self-confidence.

1238,"October 11, 2005 6:26AM",stickguy,"the 442 looks ok, but overpriced and not really much of a project.

the galaxie, otoh, looks like a good porject candidate. the bin might be a bit high, but the car looks/sounds clean and straight. if it is good metal (no rust), you could do a lot with it pretty easily. i actually like a few of those early '60s fords, about the only large detroit iron of that time period that i can stand."
1239,"October 11, 2005 6:31AM",andre1969,"the 442 to the monte ss as well. i think partly because they didn't make nearly as many...they actually cranked out upwards of 40,000 monte ss'es a year for awhile there, and i think the grand national got up to around 20-25,000 in its peak, but the 442/hurst usually only saw a few thousand per year. the cutlass already had an aerodynamic nose, so there was also no need to tack one on as they did with the monte. and finally, cutlasses tended to have nicer interiors than montes.

the 307 is a good motor, but i think the 305 breathes better. the 305 in the ss and the 307 in the 442 were both rated at 180 hp, but i think the ss was a bit faster. as for durability, i think the 307 tended to get carbon buildup in the valves and combustion chambers as the miles piled up. i also knew a guy who had one that sludged, but he never took care of anything, sending many cars to an early grave. i've also heard that the olds block was a stronger block than the chevy block. something about using more nickle in the iron? it was also actually a lighter block. it was designed from the get-go to handle a wide range of displacements, while chevy actually trimmed too much off their original 265 block in 1955, and then had to use more of a band-aid approach to beefing it back up, which resulted in it being heavier than if it had been designed more sturdy to begin with. also, by the 70's and 80's, the chevy block tended to go through crankshafts prematurely.

that being said though, i had an '86 monte with a 305 (non-ss, just the stock 150 hp unit) that was still running fine at 192k miles when it got t-boned, and my '85 silverado has a 305 with around 115k miles that shows no signs of dying anytime soon. it has problems with the carb/choke, but the driveline still feels solid."
1240,"October 11, 2005 6:36AM",andre1969,"my dad had a '64 galaxie xl with the 390 when he was a teen. he actually hated it, but that's because he was a major chevy fan. he thought it was slow, but compared to some of the other cars he had, like a '63 impala ss409 and a '65 impala ss396, it was! in retrospect though, he said it was probably one of the best cars he'd ever had. it was in great shape, and probably fast enough. i think it was an automatic too, another reason he would've hated it at the time."
1241,"October 11, 2005 7:35AM",lemko,i wouldn't mind that '53 caddy as something to drive around on nice days. where is it? it better be in really nice shape for $5k. it's probably a low-line series 62.

suppose you could get a car like this for around $1,000 - fairly solid, little rust, rebuildable engine and transmission. you can get labor for free or almost for free, you have some extra parts around that you can have for free or almost for free, and you can get other parts at dealer cost. you know a very skilled retired body and paint guy who works out of his garage very inexpensively. suppose you just want the car to be a decent driver? is there any way you could keep your head above water?"
1243,"October 11, 2005 7:43AM",lemmer,how is your silverado otherwise? it only takes some rally wheels and big tires and a decent paint job to make those look really cool.
1244,"October 11, 2005 8:23AM",andre1969,"it's mechanically sound for the most part, but needs a/c work, the radio doesn't work, headliner's falling down, and it has some rust, with the worst part of it being on the passenger side where the rocker panel meets the back of the cab. it's a 2-tone red and white and has the 15x8 rally wheels, so it could be a pretty sharp looking truck. i have no plans to ever restore it though...just enough to keep it mechanically sound so that i can hold off buying a newer truck for as long as possible.

here's a pic of it when it was new, with my granddad standing beside it and a truck camper on the back. he only put that camper on once and drove it around the block to see how it would handle it. it didn't do too well, although i have to confess that i've put heavier loads on it than that camper! :blush:"
1245,"October 11, 2005 9:15AM",jrosasmc,that's a sharp-looking silverado you have! even though it's 20 years old can it still cruise at fast highway speeds (i.e. 65-75 mph)?
1246,"October 11, 2005 9:24AM",andre1969,"thanks! actually, the truck does pretty well on the highway, and seems to do better at higher speeds than it does with lower ones. i think part of the problem is with gearing...it has a tall 2.56:1 rear end. it also weighs about 4200 lb, and the 305 only puts out 165 hp (245 ft-lb of torque, iirc) you really have to stomp on it to get it to move out from a traffic light, and merging onto a high-speed interstate can be umm, adventurous! i have no idea what the 0-60 time would be on it, but i'd guess in its current state, maybe something pathetic like 15 seconds? even in perfect tune though, i couldn't imagine that it would do much better than 12-13. it's just that 12-13 seconds seemed a lot faster back in the 80's than it does today!"
1247,"October 11, 2005 9:49AM",Mr_Shiftright,"no. engine and trans rebuild would exceed value of the car by about double and you can't do it yourself. it may look like a vw engine but it isn't. even a free 912 with a bad engine and trans is an upside down situation. of course, you could put in a used engine and trans, and you might come up even if the car were free and in good cosmetic condition.

the seller of this car is delirious. it's worth basically nothing but parts....$300 car.

i saw a beautiful 912 sell for $10,000 a few weeks ago. it was all rebuilt, all cherry inside and out, a solid clean #2. it would cost at least $25,000 to make a shabby one look like that. and this is nothin' ""fancy"" either.

engine $10,000
paint & body (no rust) $6,000
trans $3,500
interior $2,000
suspension $2,0000
tires $800
misc $2,500"
1248,"October 11, 2005 11:10AM",lemmer,"ok, here is the deal. this is more than just a hypothetical situation. my father-in-law works here - troysport, or really he plays there because they don't actually pay him. he has a 912 race car. he thinks it would be cool if i had a 912 race car or street car or whatever.

they have a solid 912 at the shop. i think it has no driveline. i have never seen it. my fil conceivably would work on it at his leisure. i think he could probably find a decent used engine and i think he has an extra transmission he would sell me cheaply. if it was to be a road car, he has a whole decent interior that came out of his race car (i have no idea what the ""shop"" 912 looks like inside). my fil has several extra sets of fuchs with decent tires.

i know that having a vintage racer would cut way down on the cost of paint/body, interior and incidentals, but then a more serious engine and suspension would be required (i.e. - more new parts).

does this real life scenario change your analysis to any large degree?

by the way, my fil's car is at the bottom of this page. it is the yellow '66 912."
1249,"October 11, 2005 11:28AM",stickguy,"in your case, it sounds like you could get a viable (cost effective) fun car out of this. certainly can't beat the labor rate!"
1250,"October 11, 2005 11:30AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well you are talking about an enormous amount of work here, so you'd better be pretty serious about racing. i don't think i'd build it as a street car, because you'll just end up with a frankenporsche, made up of bits of this car and bits of that car. it won't fit right and won't look right.

so it would have to be a vintage racer and you'd have to be pretty serious about racing to get into this.

you can buy decent 912s for $6,500 and you'll have at least that in your project when you're done, even with free labor.

you know if it were an alfa from the 60s or a jag or even an mga, i'd say go for it as a street car, but a 912 is very iffy. besides, you can't hardly make a 912 motor go very fast...well you can scare yourself but you can't build real power into them.

buy a 911 and be happy is my advice. or a 914 where you can do really well in autocross or scca and send a 912 into the locker room. :p"
1251,"October 11, 2005 12:30PM",lemmer,"how about a used 911 engine in the 912? on second thought, forget that. i don't want your blood pressure to skyrocket.

the problem with the vintage racing is that i would have to buy a trailer and probably a better tow vehicle than the family minivan (even though barber motorsports track is only seven miles straight down the road from my house).

i'll pose this question instead. assuming some free labor and cheap parts, what can i do for a relatively inexpensive porsche project where i can stay in the black if i decide to sell it? or does it pretty much always just make sense to buy something pretty nice and problem free to start with?

by the way, my fil won't say how much money he has in his 912. he bought a decent driver off of ebay for around $6,000. without doing any additional paintwork and doing a lot of the labor himself, i would be surprised if he isn't north of $30,000. he thinks it is worth at least $20,000. it is a well-prepared car, but i am not so sure. how much is a decent '66 911 vintage racer?"
1252,"October 11, 2005 12:48PM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah, he might get $20,000 if it's set up right and is fast enough. if it's a back of the packer, maybe not so much as that.

i don't wish to be discouraging, but really you can't come out on a ""porsche project"", not never not no-how.

you're right---just buy the best car you can afford when it comes to porsches--it's always the cheapest way to go with them.

if you want to tinker with something, buy a 2.0 liter 914, but with a good engine. parts are plentiful and many are accessed right out of the vw parts bin...not the transmission or front end though----those are 911 pieces so pricey-pricey."
1253,"October 11, 2005 1:36PM",lemmer,"the problem is who do you race in a 912? at porsche club events, it is usually na 944s and occasionally a 914 or very rarely a 356. the 944s blow him away. the 914s vary based on their level of prep. at vintage races, little loti and such are vastly faster. in scca, he is lumped in with 4-cyl m3s and such that lap him like he was on a bicycle. so, most of his competition is much faster with the occasional oddball that is even far slower than him. either way, a lot of the time there is nobody to go ""toe to toe"" with.

i will stop beating this dead horse now, and move on.

ok, here is an mg race car project

mg street car, driver/light project"
1254,"October 11, 2005 1:57PM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh, you can't tangle with a lotus in scca if that's your class. at least with a 914 you can build a grenade engine and afford to blow up two of those for every 912 engine. 944s racing against 912s? oh gee...just the brakes and handling puts the 944 at a big advantage, even if power were equal.

mbg gt -- a bit heavy for the track but they are sturdy and well built little cars.

mgb gt driver -- not a bad car for the money. not sure what he means by wire wheels needing ""truing"". if that means broken spokes then we are talking some money to get them re-laced. too bad about the weber carbs---they suck gas and you gain maybe 2 hp for all the fuss and 1/2 the fuel mileage. no thanks. mallory is a good idea. too bad no overdrive, these cars really need it. i can't imagine what is sounds like in there at 104 mph-----b-17 over germany probably."

anyway, at the current bid ($750), maybe, but that assumes you can do work yourself, and you can find a good engine. i might be more worried about the sheer volume of electrical/body issues (door locks, window motors, etc.). might eat up your budget just fixing them!

if you have the mechanical ability to tackle it, might be worth a shot, but i think it really needs someone with tools and a mechanically excellent 944 that was rearended, so you can just combine parts.

maybe i should just buy a $500 xj6 and put a $500 chevy small block in it."

and....this model of 944 is still depreciating anyway. you won't even keep up with inflation if you bought a mint one. if it were an '89 s2 model i might have said ""maybe"".

the porsche game is not for newbies; you need to do your homework on models, costs, etc. first or you'll really screw up.

wrecking yard for this car.

yeah, you could run an xj6 with a chevy small block, but then you are throwing out the best part of the xj, which is the engine. i don't get the point of it personally. it's the cooling system, electrics and steering and suspension that causes all the problems, and those will still be in there to haunt you. besides that, a jagolet is sale-proof.

what a rat. that dude must have finally figured out how buried he is (and how much further he would be if he continued) and decided to cut/run. that car needs a huge amount of $$$ to complete correctly, and will never be worth the amount dumped in.

i love the listed reasons for selling these half-completed projects. too many toys, wife wants garage, job change, etc. i bet most of them are closer to ""spend the entire college fund, no more money left to throw into the black hole.."""
1284,"October 13, 2005 8:24AM",fintail,"that porsche is awful. i loathe it when people ""update"" older porsches like that, trying to hide the real car. it's like rebadging a mercedes.

and the adobe thing is hilarious. maybe it's their sport model. i wonder if it has custom contour seats and a beverage gripping dash."

1286,"October 13, 2005 8:44AM",british_rover,i would say no to the edsels but the studebaker might be worth saving would have to see a picture though.
1287,"October 13, 2005 9:17AM",Mr_Shiftright,"gee, rusted 4-door edsels and studebakers....there's a fortune to be made!!!

no, i could really only see these as parts cars for those precious little trim pieces you can't find anymore for your 2 door hardtop or ragtop edsels or for your lark convertible. they're probably worth a couple hundred bucks apiece, though...a little better than scrap metal.

69 chevelle -- the car has been bastardized so you can't expect original value pricing....however, as a modified street car it's probably worth $8,500 as it sits. the only 60s chevelles worth serious money are the ss models."
1288,"October 13, 2005 9:48AM",fintail,"i think this is worth finishing. it seems to only need paint, and you don't see these hardtops often"
1289,"October 13, 2005 10:02AM",Mr_Shiftright,"eh...he says ""paint this car and double it's value"" but really it's ""paint this car for $5,000 and make it worth $2,000 more"". rust on the hood means a lot of work to treat and seal this and also at least cut the old paint down and see what's going on elsewhere.

it's a 4-door not a 2 door hardtop. big difference.

still, if you bargained hard on the price and went for a more cheapo paint job (maybe $2,000) and did some of the prep work yourself, you'd come out okay on it."
1290,"October 13, 2005 11:47AM",fintail,"yeah, i look at most craigslist cars as diy projects. that pontiac actually has rust on the roof...which might be worse than the hood, more area, and those touchy seams where the roof and pillars meet."
1291,"October 13, 2005 12:15PM",lemmer,"these capris have not held up as well as miatas in many ways. maybe ok as a beater, but i wouldn't fix it.

i don't see how this alfa kit car is worth much of anything.

1934 pontiac, does stuck valve mean big $?"
1292,"October 13, 2005 12:15PM",Mr_Shiftright,collectors just don't seem to want to pay any kind of serious money for 4-door hardtops. it's not that popular a body style. they'd even take a 2-door post over them.
1293,"October 13, 2005 2:26PM",gsemike,"how bastadizes is it really? i saw more that was original than not. i agree that it's a little pricey, but alot of these other basket cases running around make this look showroom."
1294,"October 13, 2005 5:37PM",Mr_Shiftright,doesn't look too bad. we'd have to know the engine/trans/diff numbers to see if the car is a frankencar or not. still priced too high for a plain malibu 350 i think--but if i could see the car i might change my mind. the camera lies so well and i've seen so many nice photo cars turn into wavy-sleds with mildew trunks and overspray and cobbled up engine compartments that i'm fairly cautious on pricing.
1295,"October 13, 2005 6:32PM",Mr_Shiftright,no question about this one: (it was a honda civic)
1296,"October 13, 2005 6:34PM",Mr_Shiftright,
1297,"October 13, 2005 6:49PM",xwesx,eh.... the trunk lid looks to be in pretty good shape! what about the speakers in the rear? :p
1298,"October 13, 2005 6:54PM",fintail,"i figure...pick up that pontiac for 4k if it is as decent as it looks...give it 2k worth of amateur bodywork/paint, and you've got a good cruiser. that's what most old cars should be all about."
1299,"October 13, 2005 7:15PM",jrosasmc,what year do you believe that poor civic was?
1300,"October 13, 2005 7:41PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i couldn't even tell...maybe 2001 or something like that.

the defender was burned to a crisp inside as well. all melted...the dash looked like a dripping ice cream cone."
1301,"October 13, 2005 7:42PM",Mr_Shiftright,"here's a $100,000 total (that's about the pay off for insurance). it's a 2002 porsche twin turbo with special x-50 engine package: notice the side damage but also in the second photo the rear wheel/suspension has collapsed and also damaged the motor no doubt."
1302,"October 14, 2005 5:27AM",andre1969,"i always thought the '57 pontiac wore the 4-door hardtop style very well. much better than the chevy of that year. as far as i know, it was the same roof, but somehow it looks sleeker and better balanced than on the chevy...maybe because the pontiac was a lot longer overall?"
1303,"October 14, 2005 6:21AM",british_rover,that defender brakes my heart and that is a 110 edition too so very rare if that photo was taken state side.
1304,"October 14, 2005 6:48AM",lemmer,"why are defenders worth so much? this is a cheap one - others are in the high $60s.

can't you get any other '93 land rover for about $4k?"
1305,"October 14, 2005 6:51AM",stickguy,"i'm sure there are plenty of people that would be happy to sell you a 12 yo rover with 85k on it for $4,000, although they may pay you more if you get it out of their driveway before it leaks anything else :blush:

$43,000 for this thing? only redeaming feature is it is a stick shift!"
1306,"October 14, 2005 6:51AM",lemmer,how much for a 944s2? this one looks nice.
1307,"October 14, 2005 6:55AM",stickguy,"now that one looks a lot better than the other rats you dug up!

i'm sure shifty will say it's overpriced, but 9k doesn't seem like too much to me, if the engine work was done correctly, and all the other associated stuff (pumps/belts/clutch) were done when it was apart. if the work was done right, it should be good for a long time.

i would be tempted by that car at that price (after a real good inspection by a porsche expert) if it dropped into my lap locally."
1308,"October 14, 2005 6:56AM",stickguy,"one thing that concerns me is someone that owns a car for 15 years, then obviously spends a fortune on a rebuild, only to sell it 6 months later? why?"
1309,"October 14, 2005 8:25AM",jaserb,"i think that happens a lot, and it's a psychological thing. someone spends a bunch of money fixing a car thinking ""well, i'm gonna keep this forever."" then after they spend the big money and something else little breaks they start thinking, ""well, i don't want this thing to start nickling and diming me to death"". finally it's ""sheesh, if i don't get rid of this thing it's going to eat me alive! i've spent $5k on it this year!""
i bought a beautiful 1991 maxima for my brother earlier this year. the po had babied it from new, and had just put brand new michelins on it, replaced all the belts and hoses including the timing belt, put in a new battery, starter, and alternator, flushed the transmission, replaced all the fuel injectors, replaced all 4 struts and strut mounts, and recharged the a/c. seriously, it drives and looks like a new car. the only flaw i could find was that the in-dash clock only worked intermittently. so basically she had taken care of all the repair / maintenance items - meaning it's good to go for probably another 50k miles with nothing but gas and oil - and then she decided she needed a more reliable car!

-jason"
1310,"October 14, 2005 9:26AM",british_rover,that is a 110 model defender they only sold them in the us for one year in 1993 and only brought in 200 or so. up until 1993 there was no land rover north america the company was called range rover north america because only range rovers had been sold in north america for the past 15 or so years. the introduction of the defender 110 was something of a promotional event to announce the name change and the lauch of the discovery in 1994 and the defender 90 also in 1994.
1311,"October 14, 2005 10:27AM",fintail,"i know old commercials are worth almost nothing, but this is kind of funny

i don't know if the owners claims are true...i doubt it"
1312,"October 14, 2005 10:39AM",jrosasmc,"how many miles did that maxima have when you got it? those older nissans have a great reputation for running forever with minimal maintenance.

oh yeah what do you make of older audis (say, late '80s/early '90s)? my friend wants to get one as a project and to beat on for the winter."
1313,"October 14, 2005 10:57AM",stickguy,"hard to tell what it needs, and i have no idea what a real nice resto one is worth, but it does look like a good project base. at least when you are done, you have a nice, usable ""muscle"" convertible. if it doesn't have the correct motor, etc., deduct $$ since it will just be a driver.

used audis? yes to beating on one for the winter, but as a project, bad bad idea 9and expensive too!)"
1314,"October 14, 2005 2:20PM",Mr_Shiftright,"nope, not overpriced on the 1989 porsche 944s2. it's the first one he came up with that a) wasn't a rat and b) was more than fairly priced. i've seen them up to $13k but of course that's for a 1991. a good buy at $9k if it checked out.

remember, all front-engine porsches are just used cars. the older they are, the less they are worth----not like collectible cars which is the other way 'round ----older means more valuable----but----not always either!

oddly enough, a 1965 mustang is worth more than a 1915 model t ford---so age doesn't translate into greater value automatically, even if the car is ""collectible"".

audis: audis are dead in the water in terms of resale value but some of them are great buys and great cars. for instance, you can buy a 1992=1994 audi s4 turbo awd sedan with 5 speed, fully optioned, for $6,500. that's a hell of a lot of car for the money.

but stickguy is right, they ""can be"" expensive to fix, depending. power steering hose for an s4? maybe $500 just for the part. headlights both sides...try $1,000. but other items can be quite reasonable. so it depends. again, you need to do your homework---can you imagine buying a nice used s4 that only needed a power steering hose and replacement of two broken headlights? hey, you'd say---that's nothing!"
1315,"October 14, 2005 3:15PM",andre1969,"this one before. even though it's probably a bit pricey, and i'm sure a slug with the 260 v-8, i like the idea of having a lemans that adults could fit in the back seat of! also, i wonder why i keep finding these things in ohio?! did pontiacs in general and lemanses in particular sell better in ohio, or something? here in maryland, the '76-77 seemed fairly obscure even when they were still fairly new!"
1316,"October 14, 2005 3:20PM",andre1969,"i like this beast too! i just wish they said which v-8 it had in it. could've been a 301, 350, 400, or 403. heck, i guess there's a chance a 260 or 305 might've ended up in there, too! it's funny how you can put 18"" wheels on a smallish, upright modern car and they don't look out of place, but on a mastodon like this (they were small compared to the pre-downsized big cars, and smaller even than some pre-downsized intermediates back then, but still pretty big) they just look like overkill."
1317,"October 14, 2005 4:02PM",jrosasmc,"i realize what you're saying about parts prices on certain audis. they can be more expensive than, say, saab or volvo parts but maybe that's because they're german-made (i don't really know).

the s4, though, is just a turbo version of the more plebeian 100 series, which i imagine would be cheaper to maintain and run than an s4. i tell potential audi buyers to avoid 4000s and 5000s at all costs though, even the 1989-91 100/200 series (which was just a renamed 5000). i remember a reputable tech telling me once that 5000s just assaulted their owners in terms of maintenance costs."
1318,"October 14, 2005 4:08PM",stickguy,"ok shifty, you find me a '94 s4 stick that's clean as a whistle for 6k, and i'll be happy to buy it. certainly cheaper than a new is250 @35k!"
1319,"October 14, 2005 4:10PM",stickguy,"so, i wasn't nuts to think that 9k for that porsche if it was really that clean was out of line. don't think i can fit the whole family in it though (2 kids in back), but i could try!"
1320,"October 14, 2005 4:20PM",Mr_Shiftright,"actually i just did find a sharp one but asking is $7,500. i think i'm going to buy it myself! it's a '92 which imo is the best year for the s4, as it has the rear sway bar and other interesting options that the '94 doesn't have. i hate to give up the porsche 928 but their value just keeps sinking and sinking and it needs a quick $3,500 to get it up once again to my standards. however, one can always unload a clean s4 no matter what. those who know, know what a fab car it is."
1321,"October 14, 2005 4:23PM",Mr_Shiftright,"no you weren't nuts---you spotted a good deal (presuming the car is ready to roll).

'77 bonneville -- i wish people would post vin numbers. the 5th number in that car's vin gives you the engine size (at least the one the factory put in there). there's not a v-8 of that year though that would pull skin off rice pudding, sad to say. i mean, a 350 v-8 putting out 140 hp is pretty pathetic....however if you got the gas-sipping (sarcasm alert) 455 you could get 200 hp out of it."
1322,"October 14, 2005 5:26PM",jrosasmc,that s4 is a steal...get it while you can! i know you will take exceptional care of the vehicle.
1323,"October 14, 2005 5:26PM",jrosasmc,then what will happen to the 928 if you ditch it?
1324,"October 14, 2005 6:28PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well since we are talking about projects, etc., here are some real numbers that i have to deal with. maybe it will help you all in some way to ponder these machinations of mine as well. hope so.

probably trade the 928 towards the s4. why? well, i won't get much for it on the trade, tht's true, but since the porsche shop is giving me a good deal on the front end, i really can't get greedy on the back end. they can fix up the 928 a lot cheaper than i can. it needs water pump ($1,500 retail), tie rod, front brakes and rotors, ac servo motor, rear shocks, rear tires, cruise control module, ripped front seat repaired, cracked rear tail light lens, one busted exhaust header bolt, cracked windshield washer bottle. that's $3k-$4k retail, which is about what the car is worth. soooooo....if i got $2k trade in i'd be happy man.

true, i ""lost"" money over a couple years (maybe $4,500 bucks total) but that's two years of use (22,000 miles) and fun.

this is about right on target to keep a somewhat exotic used car repair and happy....around .20 cents a mile. obviously, i am now on the debit end of the stick with the car.

to fix it myself and sell it, i'd only get perhaps $,4000--$4,500. let's say $6,000 and i hit the jackpot. so, why spend $4,000 to make $4,000??

i could sell it as a ""project"" to somebody, but really unless they were porsche mechanics they'd end up a loser. i'd rather not do that to some starry-eyed young lad.

you win some, you lose some. i made out like a bandit on the mercedes diesel, recuping almost 90% of all my repairs and maintenance at the time of sale. on this car, i only recouped about 30%. but i'll be getting an s4 which will at least never depreciate another dollar and is a really fast and fun car.

listen to me, i haven't even done any of this yet!!

yes yes i should ""get practical"" and buy a toyota, but every time i try, i get behind the wheel of one, go ten blocks and start to get spasms and shortness of breath.

they tell us ""you are not your car"" and that's true, certainly, but driving is such a pleasure to me----it's the last refuge where i can say ""no compromise""...well that and trying to stay single i guess :p"
1325,"October 15, 2005 5:45AM",jrosasmc,"shifty i might say that you're better at numbers than i am. :p

where is the s4 currently located- is it at a dealer or private seller? i should note that i did drive a '93 about a year ago and it was one of the most fun drives i ever had in my life. i swear that car will run rings around my volvo!"
1326,"October 15, 2005 8:02AM",Mr_Shiftright,"it belongs to my mechanic's wife, so i expect it's in pretty good shape. not wild about the color (white) but it's okay. i'll know more monday.

yeah i think the s4 is pretty quick. if in good fettle, it should do 0-60 in about 6.5 seconds---which is actually on second faster than my porsche 928 (i have the early 4.5 liter motor). it's a porky car, though, the s4, at almost 3,800 lbs. that's the awd business doing that.

if you live near a ski area (i'm 3 hours out of tahoe) you can always sell an awd audi for a decent price. they are fabulous snow cars, and will often easily go where the big suv awds cannot go....the big trucks have road height but the audis have fabulous traction and control--especially up steep grades."
1327,"October 15, 2005 8:06AM",jrosasmc,"here where i live in the southern part of vermont, audi quattros are always selling for some insane amounts of $$."
1328,"October 16, 2005 10:03AM",fintail,"not a collecible, but if this is a local car and is clean/rustfree, it has to be worth it with those miles

80s pimp style with no horsepower. i think these cars actually look clean and sharp if they don't have the vinyl top and all the other tack-ons"
1329,"October 16, 2005 10:55AM",Mr_Shiftright,"please forgive me, but i think those cars are hideous. they're like a rollling course in ""what not to do in design school"".

but sure, for $1,200, you're right they are worth it."
1330,"October 16, 2005 11:18AM",andre1969,"but i'd be afraid of the caddy's 4.1 v-8. that new yorker should still have plenty of life left in it, though. they were among some of the better built, more reliable domestics of the time, and could take a lot of abuse.

still though, i think the gran fury/diplomat look better than the nyer...less ostentatious i guess. and i'd take a toro or riv in a heartbeat over the eldorado. as strange as it sounds, while the early 80's may have been the dark ages for many cars, especially cadillac, it was almost a bit of a golden era, relatively speaking, for olds and buick their larger v-8 models were some of the most reliable cars of the era."
1331,"October 16, 2005 2:02PM",fintail,"i didn't find those cars based on anything but price and practicality, with some uniqueness thrown in.

do you like the toro or riv over the eldo based on looks or based on mechanicals? i've never minded the eldo, if it isn't pimped out. it has to have the stainless steel top and no pimpy grille or anything. then again, i've always kind of like bustleback sevilles, but without the carriage top and all that crap as well.

the eldo also reminds me of deniro's role in ""casino"", and what's-her-name who rams it with the mercedes 107 sl. i have a strange association with dodge diplomats too...when i was in 1st grade or so, i lived in a brand new housing development, and when we moved in the streets were in, but most houses didn't yet have landscaping. two doors down from us lived people who had a diplomat, and they always parked it in the dirt yard. to this day i think of rednecks parking on the lawn when i think of diplomats.

well, it *looks* nice, but i bet it drives awful"
1332,"October 16, 2005 2:31PM",andre1969,"i think mechanicals do have a lot to do with it, because i'd much rather have an olds 307 than a caddy 249. although i think the eldorado did come standard with an olds 350 in '79. actually, iirc, the toro and riv did, too. and in 1980 i think you could still get something decent in the eldo, like either an olds 350 or caddy 368. so i could put up with a '79-80 eldo!

another reason i think i prefer the riv and toro is the interior. there's just something about caddy interiors in general around that timeframe that just seemed tacky and overdone compared to an equivalent olds or buick.

oh, and to further your diplomat/redneck association, i have to confess that my '89 gran fury spent an awful lot of time parked on the lawn. either over at my grandma's across the street or at my place! and i have a few vehicles scattered out in the yard right now. :blush: but at least we're not in a housing development...heck out here having a '79 nyer parked in the yard probably gives the neighborhood a touch of class! :shades:"

1336,"October 16, 2005 9:21PM",fintail,"yeah, that supra looks like a bargain if it is as nice as the seller lets on, he could want more for it. i wonder if it is sold already. i like those too."
1337,"October 17, 2005 7:32AM",lemmer,"they are decent, comfortable, sporty cruisers. the engines are really nice and have good torque. as long as you don't expect to have the reflexes of a similar year rx-7, it sounds like a pretty good car.

in 1992, i had the choice between a car just like this one and a first generation rx-7. i bought the rx-7, and it was a load of oversteering, high revving fun until the engine blew right at a year after i bought it."
1338,"October 17, 2005 9:29AM",Mr_Shiftright,"price is actually high retail market price. don't let the ""supra"" name of the later glory years fool you. this is a pretty ordinary old car. but hey, any japanese car that's clean and decent looking should be worth about that much."
1339,"October 17, 2005 11:10AM",ghulet,"this should, might, get you around for three weeks or so, til something expensive goes kaput:

probably kinda fun to drive, when it runs. for the price, you could hardly go wrong."
1340,"October 17, 2005 11:14AM",Mr_Shiftright,"the audi gt is a fun car and certainly worth more than the asking price. depends on how bad the rust is or what the ""exhaust noise"" is, whether it's worth patching up and driving or even flipping for a profit.

hell i'd buy it just to sell the parts off it at that price. the quattro version of this car is worth good money but many parts will interchange, so you'd get quattro people wanting bits and pieces."
1341,"October 17, 2005 11:25AM",stickguy,"for $300, i would take a flyer on it. at least it runs. whatever the rust is, it isn't too apparent in the pictures, so it should last a while, or you could do some diy bondo work in the driveway. who knows what the exhaust noise is.

i agree that you could probably chop it up and turn a profit, so you really don't have much to loose. or, just drive it til it drops (it is winter beater time soon after all).

this is scary, i keep getting sucked into old, high mile audis. good thing none of them are very close to me!

still, i would buy the gt if i saw it parked on a front lawn, assuming it didn't sound like a threshing machine when you started it up."
1342,"October 17, 2005 12:04PM",Mr_Shiftright,"old audis are expensive to keep running, no doubt about it."
1343,"October 17, 2005 12:14PM",lemmer,"i was looking at some audis from 2000-2002, and i don't think there is any left that don't have malfunctioning radio/climate control/computer displays. they have those bright red letters, so it is hard to ignore that part or all of some letters and numbers are missing.

i hope you have better luck with the s4 you are looking at. did you go see it today?

these a4s are getting cheap."

arggghhh! i'm not sure what to buy. i hate debt. an old s4 i can just write a check for.

i drove the mitsubishi evo rs and that sure was fun. that car would keep me amused i think, but i""m not sure mitsubishis age all that well. fab warranty though----5/60 bumper to bumper and 10/100k drivetrain warranty, $25,500 sellling price. dealer is a friend so no hassles on warranty, service, etc.

i can even get the wingless version.

1349,"October 17, 2005 2:37PM",steine13,"i'd like to observe this:
that audi is great for $300. so long as it runs ok right now, and no money is to be invested in it.

let's not forget this is snow country -- chicago, mi, same difference. i had a 1987 audi 4000, nice car, in 1997. in the fall of that year, i had a new pressure accumulator put in the fuel system. bad move; where they bent the fuel lines to get at it, they broke and leaked. so there i was, in november, lying in my driveway with a funnel, an empty 2l coke bottle, and a car with an empty tank up on jack stands. next to me a fire extinguisher to look good for the missus, and a hacksaw blade in my hand. i cut out the leak and bridged it with high-pressure rubber hose.

in '88, they went to powercoated fuel lines; it's nice to see someone paying attention.
but the point of all this rambling is that these older audis are nice cars, but they work far better in their natural habitat than in the salt belt.

most 928s were automatic and for the early cars this is probably better for most people. the car loses its thrill with the auto, but the twin-disk clutch on the early cars needs to be done ""just right"", by a knowledgable wrench--which doesn't mean a 911 mechanic or a guy with a german accent and an attitude. it means somebody who knows and likes 928s. my clutch is very smooth but most aren't.

78-79 were prototype cars and should be avoided. with a 928, the newer you can afford, the better....but if you get a good one from the get-go, they'll run literally forever. none of us have ever seen a blown 928 motor but we have seen head gaskets go out when the driver overheats and ""just drives another 60 miles"" to get home.

the auction car seems a bit raggedy-assed. biggest problem is repainting over white. if you could buy it for a grand, never touch it, and punch the gas and go yahoo for a year...hey, that's okay.

but this is not the old 928 you want to invest in. at least go find a more original car.

my only ""complaint"" about the car is that it doesn't sound or look anywhere near as ferocious as it is---also it smells like an old german car inside, and there is a tint on the rear door glass and rear windshield. i hate tinting that has that kind of blue/purpley hue to it.

just debating here whether to rehab the 928 for $3k (mechanicals, tires, detailing, new seat covering and padding, and cocoa floor mats) or spring for a new/old car-that-costs-a-lot-to-fix for $7,500. theoretically the audi has all been gone through and won't be bad to me, but......"

1381,"October 18, 2005 9:42PM",ghulet,"......ad is funny!! i love 'i don't want to part it out, so don't ask.' what, of any real value, is there to 'part out' of a shell of a car that has no engine/trans, missing most of the interior and has no body trim whatsoever? oh, this is even better: 'the car has a good body from what i can tell, there does not appear to be any repaired body damage', then goes on to explain the welding, rust repair, body filler and existing rear and engine compartment damage. uuuhhmmm, ok. and who the hell buys one of these from illinois (i wouldn't and i live here) and takes it to california? just a little bass ackwards.

methinks this is as little of a car as is allowed to sit in his driveway without being towed away by the local authorities! needless to say, $2100 is about three times crazy; how much is a nice one worth?

that '63 (seller refers to as a '64) cadillac seems like a relative bargain. i mean, nice ones aren't worth all that much, so an over-restoration would be a mistake, but at least the interior and body look decent and intact, and seller claims engine and trans are good. i think, especially on cars like cadillacs that have lots of electrics and fancy trim, that the interiors end up being a big pain and expense that many amateur restorers don't consider."

and compared to a 1960 plymouth, they're drop-dead gorgeous! :p those things were very popular for dodge when they were new, too. iirc, dodge sales jumped from something like 156,000 in 1959 to around 370,000 for 1960. dart sales were actually higher than the full-sized plymouths, and dodge would've probably outsold plymouth that year were it not for the valiant, of which dodge had no equivalent that year."

i would if i actually had the time to use it.... my grandparents own this boat and have wanted to sell it for years, but they want substantially more for it and nobody will invest that much in a 26 year old boat with a small ""fishing"" deck. i keep telling them to drop their price, but they go back to the ""do you know how much we've invested in it?!"" argument. i tell them that price is dictated by the market, but who am i? :sick:"
1388,"October 19, 2005 3:31PM",Mr_Shiftright,nah it's overpriced. your grandparents need to see what you can buy for $25k and that will sober them up i think. it's probably worth $8k-$12k at the most.
1389,"October 19, 2005 6:04PM",xwesx,"hmmm... maybe regional variations? i imagine the markets are a lot different as far as what people buy/want down in the l48. this is not a lake vessel, though i imagine it could be used for that.

a friend of mine just purchased a bayliner (worthless for alaska waters) for more than that and it was smaller in length, width, had one engine (i'd never take a one-engine boat on the ocean), and needed some fairly serious redecorating/upholstering. i told him he was nuts, but he got a ""good deal"" compared to a lot of the boats out there. i didn't say too much because it was his money.

8k would be giving it away. i cannot agree with you on that one. oh, but maybe you're on the right track with the 12k suggestion assuming no trailer. the trailer is probably close to half the value. while nobody has been too interested in buying the boat itself at the price they want (last i heard they had gone down to $42k), many have begged and pleaded to get the trailer. :confuse: i can think of maybe one time a year when i would use a trailer that large."

just because people put money into something doesn't mean that increases the value of it.

porsche 928 -- looks like a real nice car. might be worth more than the equivalent year domestic 928 due to vast power increase. don't bring it to california though, it won't pass smog regulations unless you have dot/epa papers and stickers affixed. i'll track it and see what it sells for. it's nicer than mine at any rate.

i think the ford 302 block weighs about 100 pounds less than the chevy smallblock. i think the ford engine likes to rev more than the chevy engine, as well, with having the short stroke. i wonder if a ford v-8 might be a better candidate for swapping in to some of these sports cars whose owners have the urge to ""domesticate"" them?"

the long black rod coming from the center console is an adjustable reading light. the mount above it is for a cell phone. the gauge is a battery amp readout. it was put there because, the alternator is larger than stock to handle the amount of extra stuff added. stereo amps, ect. if you look on the floorboard passenger side you will also see the hand set cable for the cb radio. thanks for the interest."
1404,"October 20, 2005 3:05PM",Mr_Shiftright,"no, no, i have no problem putting a nasty v8 in a 928 because it already has a nasty v8 in there. it's when people put them in jaguars and porsches, where they most definitely do not belong (and they aren't built for that level of torque so frame-bending is common), that i get into a snit.

there's a real nice kit to put a chevy in a 928 (i think the company is renegade or something like that) and also a blower kit for the stock 928 engine which looks really nice but you have to pony up $5k-6k for that.

there was another style that i think was called the ""flattop"", which had a big, over-exaggerated, wraparound rear window. iirc, it was only offered on the 1959-60 hardtop sedans, although some 2-door sedans might have used it too."

and this 1982 ltd looks like a lot of car for the money. doesn't say which engine it has, though. while the panther-based ltd/crown vic has always had a v-8 standard, around this timeframe a weak 255 cid unit was the base engine. probably would've made it as slow as the slant six lebaron!

1414,"October 21, 2005 7:40AM",1racefan,"is that a 6cylinder maverick? my grandfather had a powder blue '72 or '74 coupe back when i was a kid. it was a stickshift, on the column. the car was ugly, and it always had problems with the a/c and the heat, but it ran like stink. he drove it well over 150k miles, and then sold it to someone he worked with. that guy rear ended someone with the car, fixed it, and i think it is still in service today."
1415,"October 21, 2005 7:42AM",stickguy,"too much for a plain 4 door. maybe if it was a grabber with a 302 and 4 speed stick it might be worth 3k (to me, anyway). even though this one is in nice shape, no one wants a survivor 4 door '73 compact like this. it's just an old car to buy real cheap and use up, not a ""classic"""
1416,"October 21, 2005 7:44AM",andre1969,"but i'm sure it's just a 6-cyl. i think most of them had 200 inline 6'es, although i think the 250 was available. you could also get a 302 v-8 in them. they were actually pretty lightweight, especially the coupes, so i'd imagine that one with a 302 might be a pleasant surprise, and even a 6-cyl might still be adequate."
1417,"October 21, 2005 7:48AM",qbrozen,"welll..... to me, classic just means its old. doesn't mean its ""collectible.""

i look at it like this ... i don't believe i can buy any better low-mile, easy-to-work-on, solid, large-by-today's-standards sedan for that kind of money.

and the ability to work on it and repair it cheap is definitely something it has over more recent cars. for $2500, i'd be looking at an 80k+ mile, 10-year-old saturn or some other such thing. and when that breaks, you throw it out. like i said before, tranny goes out on this, i can rebuild for a couple hundred bucks. ""computer"" goes out, its $50. carb rebuild? what's that? $80? so it just makes more sense to me to spend $2500 on this than the aforementioned saturn/hyundai/mundane domestic, etc."
1418,"October 21, 2005 7:52AM",stickguy,"as long as you keep in mind you will be driving early 60's technology (since i think the maverick is riding on a glorified falcon chassis). not everyone used to a modern, fwd car (even a saturn) is going to be able to deal with that. plus, 30 years old is getting up there for a daily driver.

even if it is worth 2.5k for you, why pay that if the rest of the market considers it a 1k (or whatever) car?

still, i agree that it is simple to work on and can be cheap to own, but even by '73 the emissions stuff was getting kind of hinky, unless it has all been stripped off."

1420,"October 21, 2005 8:57AM",Mr_Shiftright,"hey good score in a perverted sort of way:

gt6 -- once described as ""possibly the worst car in the world"", but i suspect that is a bit harsh, even if uttered by a british writer. this was triumph's answer to the datsun 240z (careful, don't spit coffee all over your keyboard).

benz 219 -- in a similar vane, this is probably benz's worst postwar car ever. quite unsuccessful, it was quickly discontinued, which makes it one of those ""rare for very wrong reasons"" type of cars. definitely ready to be banged into turkish teapots for tourists.

benz 380sec -- yes, very seductive for the price, and possibly an okay buy if you get lucky. problem with the 380/250/450 sls and slcs is that they are kind of like benign cows---lazy, heavy handlers (ever see a cow corner?), a devil to fix, and $$$ to keep running. they also have a huge appetite for fuel (or hay, if you want to keep the bovine analogy going). think two-door german buick. on the positive side, they are attractive and nice highway cars as long as you don't forget that you are not in a sports car in fact.

if you like this type of v8 benz of the ""sporty"" nature, buy a 560sl or 500sec and you'll have a much better car in every single way----except the $$$ to fix part.

right now, where i live, a total rebuild of one of those v8 engines is going to cost you $12,000--$16,000. so you know what happens when you develop clanking camshaft noises or start to burn lots of oil.

but if that 380sec ran well, i'd buy it for $1,500 and just drive it until it did something real bad....hey, kinda like a porsche 928!"
1421,"October 21, 2005 8:57AM",andre1969,"just to put the price of that maverick in perspective, i only paid $3000 for my '76 lemans. and my lemans is a coupe has a 350 v-8, air conditioning, tilt, am/fm stereo (or what passed for stereo back then), power windows, power seat, rally wheels, dual exhaust, and an interior that actually gives vinyl a new respect. so when i think $3000 for this car, to me, the maverick just doesn't seem to be worth nearly as much. but then, i could see someone else valuing the simplicity and relative economy of the maverick, or possibly just liking the maverick style and hating the lemans style, so it's all relative i guess. plus, my lemans has been repainted, so it's not original. and it has a tear in the driver's seat.

also, don't let the overblown sizes in general of the 70's distort your impression of the maverick. they're actually pretty cramped inside...a modern toyota corolla or honda civic probably gives you more interior room! and they had huge transmission/driveshaft humps. while they were considered a compact car, they were considerably smaller, both inside and out, than a dart, valiant, or any of the nova derivatives, all cars that could probably pass for midsize these days. truthfully, even my lemans isn't that big inside. the way i have the seat adjusted, it actually feels huge up front, but you couldn't fit an adult in the back seat. and the trunk, i'd guess, is about 15 cubic feet....about that of a honda accord. coupes back then tended to have really small back seats."
1422,"October 21, 2005 9:02AM",andre1969,"if i really needed another car, and it ended up being as nice in person, i'd actually consider that lebaron! i'm not crazy about a slant six in something that heavy...90 hp, maybe 160 ft-lb of torque, and a 3300 lb or so body just doesn't sound like a good combination. plus, they probably stuck it with a 2.94:1 rear just so the engine could move all that mass, so it probably gets worse real-world economy than the 318!"
1423,"October 21, 2005 9:05AM",qbrozen,"yup. just stuff carried over from the 60s. pretty much everything on my '66 stang and '79 zephyr was interchangeable.

now, market price is interesting and something shifty and i have disagreed on in the past. fact is, try to find another in the exact condition and miles as this one. odds are strongly against being able to find a comparable car. so there really is no way to establish a market price for it based on other sales. can you find other mavericks? sure. can you find another one in this condition (again, assuming its as nice as advertised)? not likely.

will the seller still be hanging on to it at that price? possibly. i have to think, however, if i'm willing to pull the trigger at $2500, others will, too. and, most likely, someone somewhere will pay even more. therefore, isn't that then the definition of market price?"
1424,"October 21, 2005 9:11AM",qbrozen,"hmmm... something to think about. i'm really not familiar with mavericks. were they smaller than, say, my '79 zephyr? i was assuming it was pretty comparable, and, to me, that car was big. sure, it was dwarfed by my friend's ltd of similar vintage (these were both our high school cars at some point), but the back seat of my zephyr was almost certainly larger than my current volvo s70. oh, and the zephyr was a coupe."
1425,"October 21, 2005 9:27AM",andre1969,"the zephyr was around 196 inches long and rode a 105.6 inch wheelbase. the maverick's wheelbase was 109.9"" for the sedan, 103.3"" for the coupe. i'm not sure about overall length, but i want to say around 185 or so for the sedan?

the zephyr and fairmont were very space-efficient designs, though. they were taller, boxier, had a taller rear deck, and thinner doors, all leading to a pretty roomy interior. the only thing i remember about them that was bad was, like the maverick, they had a huge transmission and driveshaft tunnel. while they were considered compacts at the time, the fairmont and zephyr rivaled some midsized cars. in fact, i think the epa classified them as intermediates. and in later years, they served as the basis for the 1981-82 granada/cougar and 83-86 ltd/marquis, and the '80-82 and '83-88 t-bird/cougar xr-7, cars that were all marketed as midsize.

i think the zephyr might have been lighter than the maverick, too. they used some pretty small engines, like the 2.3 pinto ohc 4-cyl and 200 inline 6 (i don't think the 250 was available in these). the 255 v-8 was also offered, and the 302, which could really kick in a car this light."
1426,"October 21, 2005 9:58AM",andre1969,"your logic with that maverick and pricing is pretty much the logic i used when i bought my lemans! i've always wanted a '76-77 lemans, ever since i was a little kid...while all the normal kids back then wanted a black trans am with a gold chicken on the hood like what burt reynolds drove in smokey and the bandit, i wanted a car like sherriff justice!

so right there, it was a type of car that i actually wanted specifically, as opposed to some old battlecruiser that just happened to catch my eye. plus, it was in pretty nice shape, and very well-equipped for the time, and a nice color combination. now, if i didn't buy this one, i'm sure another lemans might have come along. but it might not have been as well-equipped, in as nice of a color (the 70's had some beautiful colors, but most people had bad taste so they chose all the nasty colors!), or it might've been in worse condition, or had a smaller engine, and so on and so on.

now, in retrospect, i'd rather have a lemans with a 400 or 455, instead of the 350 that i have. but by this time, i wonder if a 180 hp 400 or 200 hp 455 would really give me that much more excitement than the 160 hp 350 i have? probably not. and as for color, call me twisted, but there were two greens they offered back then that i would really love. one of them was a light, misty, silvery-green that is displayed on on the car on the right in this picture. the other was a darker, kind of a forest green that looked like this '73 gto

but, hey, i'm happy with it. so if someone could buy that maverick for $2500 and be happy with it, that's what counts!"
1427,"October 21, 2005 10:05AM",Mr_Shiftright,"ah grasshopper may i humbly suggest an error in your understanding of fair market.

the fair market is not based on a comparable car exactly. it is based on the ceiling price people are willing to pay for something. a brand new maverick locked in a vault and now for sale has no comparable...it may be the only one in the world...but that doesn't mean it's worth any more than a normal clean one. why? because nobody cares if a maverick is pristine or not. of if they care, they care maybe 10% more.

appraisers and price guides don't set the market, buyers do.

actually i had no problem with the asking price for the maverick. i don't know why you got a different impression. maybe due to my comments on other cars i found ""overpriced"". basically i think any really clean good running, defect-free car is worth at least $2,500 in the year 2005, regardless of make, model or age."
1428,"October 21, 2005 10:23AM",qbrozen,"oh, i wasn't really commenting on your take of this particular car. i just remember discussions we've had in the past regarding market value. i think it had to do with an rx7 and ebay, iirc.

anyway, as far as this post, i agree with everything you just said .... and its basically what i said regarding the price being what i (the buyer) am willing to pay. unless, of course, we're talking about a dime a dozen car that i lose my mind over and pay twice what 20 other guys just paid for theirs."
1429,"October 21, 2005 10:24AM",martian,"..just why are the partes so damned expensive? i mean, with a reasonable production run, one would expect that prices for pistons, valves, etc., would be pretty close to detroit pricing-face it, there is nothing 'high tech"" about pistons and connecting rods.

hard to tell from just the one pic, but this beast looks like it might have some potential.

and here's a nice low-mileage, original 1972 dart swinger which i think is a bit pricey, but i kinda like it. to me, 1972 was the last year the dart had any semblance of a sporty flair to it, and the front-end had a nice, aggressive stance to it. for '73 they went for more of a beaky look that tried to look upscale in that typical 70's fashion. something about this car looks re-painted, though!"

i think this car is a good example, of buying what you really want when the opportunity arises. for example, if i hadn't bought my '76 lemans when i did, and then saw this thing with an asking price almost twice as high, i'd really be kicking myself! okay, so this one is around 70 miles away from me, while i had to go 500 for the other one, but still!"

and this loveboat is kinda purty, although by 1979 the 460 was gone, and the 400 only put out like 166 hp. the price actually doesn't seem bad on this one, provided it looks as good in person."

and yeah, while they'd be considered huge today, those big fords were just your typical ""standard"" car of the time. iirc the '73-78 was on a 121"" wheelbase, and right around 220"" long overall. by the mid-70's, some midsized cars were almost that long. in fact, i believe the '77-79 ltd-ii (facelifted torino) wagons were actually a touch longer than the full-sized '73-78 galaxie/ltd wagons!

""a lot"" of people missed the memo, though, because it didn't sell well except into police and taxi fleets.

as for parking a battlecruiser, one thing i learned real quick when i went to college, and the under-sized parking spaces that went with the freshman lot, is that in tight quarters it's easier to back your car into a parking spot rather than pull in. this holds true whether you're in a mastodon-sized car trying to jockey around in a normal-sized parking lot, or in a small car that just happens to be in extremely tight quarters. i remember there was this cute asian girl that drove a beautiful emerald green r-body new yorker that on certain days got to the campus around the same time i did. if i saw her, i'd help guide her into the spot."

a few years ago, i used to see a guy in my neighborhood that used one of those little hardtops to deliver pizzas. seemed like it was still in pretty good shape.

the mileage is stated in the ad title, i would say it's implied to be original. and it could be.

the collector thing is funny though...a claimed fintail collector would have more credibility."
1454,"October 24, 2005 12:55PM",andre1969,"that ""collector"" sure did get his panties in an uproar! fwiw, one of my co-workers bought a 450sl back in 2000. it was either a '73 or '74. he way overpaid on it, i'm sure...something like $15,000. i drove it one day because he said his wife thought it was doing something funny...i forget what now. but i remember looking at the odometer, which read around 182,000 miles and asking him ""is that metric?!"" he said no, it was miles. i was shocked on two accounts. first, that he paid that much for something with that many miles on it. but secondly, how solid the car felt and how nice it still looked. it did have a bit of rust in the doorjamb, where the rocker meets the quarter i think (been awhile now) but that was about it.

now that i look through those pictures though, the car does look like a repaint. i think one giveaway is how while the paint is nice and shiny, if you look at the reflections in it, they have kind of a blurry, fuzzy look. and the main thing that bothers me about the interior is that it's done that thing that gm cars of the 70's tended to do, where as they aged, even if you took care of them, the different materials would fade at different rates, so eventually you'd eventually end up with 5 or 6 interior colors where originally you only had one! it's really noticeable with the center console, which has almost a pinkish hue to it. either it's just faded to that color, or it's been replaced, pulled out of another car that faded a bit differently.

at that point, the guy is fair game. i just ran through the pictures, but i also saw the rust on the lid... and if it's rusty there, what do you think the lower corners of the doors look like? they are conveniently not shown in the pictures.

1461,"October 25, 2005 7:07AM",lemmer,"minty fresh malibu. price seems obscene to me. i can't imagine that those little v8s are particularly powerful.

low mileage rambler

fun ""minivan"""
1462,"October 25, 2005 7:14AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well now we know that a nearly brand new 60s rambler is worth. i told them if they just put it away for 37 years it would be worth a fortune! :p

you're right, '79 malibu price is kind of silly. but if you don't ask, you don't get."
1463,"October 25, 2005 7:28AM",andre1969,"that malibu is nice (i even like the color combo!) but awfully pricey! horsepower fluctuated a bit back then, but that 267 probably had 115-125 hp. tranny is most likely the dreaded thm200c, although in smaller cars with the weaker engines, they usually weren't too bad. these cars are actually pretty popular with the hotrodders, because they're one of the lightest body-on-frame cars built and the engine bay can hold a big block. still, that price is high. i'd say if it had a 350 (i think it had to be special ordered, but i have seen a few with 'em over the years), and was more loaded-up (power windows/locks, and either a split bench seat or buckets and a console), and just about perfect, i might go that high. but as-is, i dunno. if i had $2500-3000 burning a hole in my pocket, and really wanted it, and had a place for it, i might spring for it. it's not as fast or as well-equipped as my '76 lemans that i paid $3,000 for, but i'm giving bonus points here for the working, retrofitted a/c and the original paint. that front seat is showing signs of stress though, and if you start using this car on a regular basis, i could see the seams busting pretty quickly. i'd also like to see some pics of the headliner...those 1-piece felt jobs tended to pull loose. also looks like the ""chrome"" peeled off the plastic trim strips on the door panels. i know that's a minor thing, but i've always wondered if that stuff can be re-plated? it looks awful once it's peeled off."
1464,"October 25, 2005 7:32AM",stickguy,"nice looking malibu. sure it's a bit pricy, but if you want one, probably hard to find another in this nice condition (as described). i actually think this is the best looking domestic of the era, and possibly one of the cleanest american designs ever for a ""normal"" car. it does sound like it has been all sorted out.

rambler? pricey, but some nostalgic person might overpay.

again, price guidelines are fine, but when you get into rare/oddball cars that are still at the low end of the price scale, it only takes one person that really wants it.

besides, paying 5k for a 3k malibu or rambler isn't the end of the world, certainly not as bad as paying 75k for a 30k ""muscle"" car!"
1465,"October 25, 2005 7:33AM",stickguy,"i love it and want it. who cares if there aren't any back seats? nice blind spot though.

to think, put a port hole in it, and some shag carpet, and you have an english pinto cruising wagon!"
1466,"October 25, 2005 7:36AM",stickguy,"actually, how the heck is that thing registered in the us? i just realized it was a 1979 model, not a '60s something that was potentially legal. would have to see some good paperwork on this one!"
1467,"October 25, 2005 7:46AM",andre1969,"who's every bit as nostalgic/lustful for that malibu as i was for my '76 lemans jumping the gun and buying it. and honestly, i've seen less desireable malibus from that era with even higher asking prices! i think about the worst i ever saw as a 1980 sedan with a 229 v-6 and no air conditioning with a $7,000 asking price! fwiw, i think that's around what my mom paid, out the door, for her 1980 coupe when it was new (with air conditioning!). now granted, it was nice, and only had around 20,000 miles on it, but still!"
1468,"October 25, 2005 7:48AM",Mr_Shiftright,"eveer drive one of those 60s ramblers? they are pretty ghastly to push around compared to a gm product. cheap and noisy basically.

mini -- yeah, you're right, better watch the paperwork on this one. just because it's in the country doesn't mean you can't get into a lot of trouble with this car.

sometimes what they do with a model of car that has a long production run is to put the modern body on an older frame, and then register it under the older frame #s. this happened all the time with citroen 2cvs you see in this country. you could do the same with a mini i would think.

also people will bring in illegal cars on one year resident visas and then switch paperwork with a us legal car, or even just hand you a foreign title or ""papers"" for the one year residency.

if it doesn't have dot/epa papers, don't buy it!"
1469,"October 25, 2005 8:38AM",fintail,"or just move to canada, where anything in sound condition over 15 years old can be brought in. strangely enough, it hasn't caused chaos, even though overpaid dot/epa cronies and egos would have you believe otherwise. regressive..."
1470,"October 25, 2005 8:38AM",jrosasmc,shifty the rambler's big straight-6 motor would run forever with little maintenance.
1471,"October 25, 2005 9:02AM",martian,"ahh..such fond memories of amc-the car that nobody wanted! my best friend in junior high got a rambler sedan (just like the one on craigslist) from his grandmother-he hated the thing! he would crash the gears and ride the clutch, and (attempted) to ""burn rubber"". he couldn't kill the damn thing! what i remember about that old heap-it had an extremely primative electrical system-basically just lights, heater and crappy am radio-one speaker! the front seats were like a rock and rubeer flooring-no carpeting. it also had vacuum-operated windshiled wipers-they slowed down when you mashed the throttle. finally, my friend loaned it to one of his football team mates-who ran it off the road and hit a tree! the pushed back onto the raod, tied on the front bumper with a piece of twine, and kept on driving!
seriously, amc should be remembered for making cars that no self-respecting teenage boy wanted to be caught dead in!"
1472,"October 25, 2005 9:26AM",martian,"a question for shifty-i was watching an old james bond movie a while back (it was the roger moore one set in bangkok). anyway, i heard that in the 1970's, the government of thailand forbade the importation of japanese cars-so oddly enough, the brand sold in thailand was..amc! hence, the rich people in thailand rode around in amc matadors and hornets! surely, some of these heaps must survive-is thailand the place where amc cars go to die?
it was really weird watching roger moore as jb flying around in an amc hornet-those things could barely make 65 mph!"
1473,"October 25, 2005 9:39AM",lemko,"that must've been the movie ""the man with the golden gun."" christopher lee and the guy who played tattoo had a flying 1974 matador coupe."
1474,"October 25, 2005 9:43AM",Mr_Shiftright,"my favorite cheapo amc features was that the labels for dash controls on the ameircans were actually decals like you put on model airplanes!!!

i don't remember the 6 cylinder pushrod engine as particularly long-lived....i recall them as clattery, rough-idling oil burners that sounded like golf balls in a clothes dryer.

but of course memory is not reliable. that's just how i recall them. the old flatheads were okay though.

epa/dot: well whether one likes the law or not, it's the law and people should pay attention to it lest they get burned big time. personally i think the epa served both good and bad purposes...it did keep a lot of useless rust-buckets out of the usa and tried to curb the abuse of importers. but like all laws, sometime they work at cross-purpose, i agree."
1475,"October 25, 2005 9:52AM",andre1969,"i think inline 6-cylinders in general tend to be pretty long-lived, simply because they don't rev fast and don't put out a lot of power. basically, they're usually just now powerful enough to hurt themselves! also, i think a lot of old and/or cheap people bought low-line stuff like amc 6-cylinders (and to be fair, slant-six mopars, 6-cyl fords and gms, etc), and those people just didn't dog them out and abuse them like the typical v-8 buyer might have."
1476,"October 25, 2005 10:16AM",fintail,"i've seen quite a few oil burning and leaking amcs. i once got behind an eagle on the highway, i swear that thing was losing actual oil particles/drops out of its exhaust. when i was a teenager my mom knew a little old lady who had a mint blue hornet wagon. her and my mom would go out now and then, and once they took the hornet. my mother said it was an awful thing.

i haven't heard of hordes of awful cars making it to canada or the market being flooded with unsafe wrecks. maybe the epa/dot should rethink their stance...but of course, that would impact someone's income, and it's not what you know...especially when you really don't answer to anybody."
1477,"October 25, 2005 10:29AM",andre1969,"a married couple, used to have a blue hornet wagon! it was kind of a robin's egg blue. she drove it, and her husband had a beat-up midnight blue '78 malibu with 200k+ miles on it. he inherited a strippo '87 sentra with a stick when his father passed away, and then in '94 they decided to get one good new car and cut back their burgeoning fleet. they bought a new civic sedan, and some kid that worked at the honda dealer bought their malibu for like $75.00.

when it came time to retire the hornet, they tried calling a few junkyards, and i even called a few. nobody would even take the car off their hands, let alone give them anything for it! we finally drove it down to a big junkyard near culpeper va, leon's auto parts, and he gave them 90 bucks for it. they had offered to give it to me, but i knew better! :p it was leaking oil really badly, but that wasn't entirely the car's fault. the valve cover gasket was leaking, and they asked me to fix it. so i got out the socket set and tightened the bolts. one of them snapped off. instead of getting it fixed professionally, they just drove it like that. i think it blew out about one quart of oil every 100 miles or so! it had around 90,000 miles on it when it got ""retired"". body was actually in good shape, except for some rust at the bottom of the doors. one of the back windows would come off its track and fall down into the door, too.

grbeck and i saw a hornet at carlisle. it was a pristine 1970 with only 28,000 miles, but was a nasty little thing! i tried to sit behind the wheel. horrible seating position, with a close-in, awkwardly angled steering wheel. i don't think fat people could drive these things very comfortably! and the brake pedal was much closer than the gas pedal, making it very awkward to move your foot from one to the other. in fact, i couldn't do it without bending my leg at an extremely awkward angle, otherwise i'd hit the steering wheel with my leg!

yet, as bad as this thing was, i know i drove my friends' hornet wagon a few times back in the day! and i don't remember it being that bad. but then, maybe i've just gotten spoiled by newer and better cars since then, so i forgot how bad it was?"
1478,"October 25, 2005 10:34AM",stickguy,"ah, memories. i had (in my college days, when i cycled through cheap used cars at a rapid pace) not only a hornet (hatchback), but also a gremlin! apparently i was a slow learner.

i actually liked them both, and thought they drove fine, but this was the early 80's. if nothing else, they drove as well as my '73 duster and '67 camaro (6 cyl, pg), and where at least not at all rusty (unlike the others).

i imagine if i drove one now i would be aghast at the discomfort level, but at the time, any wheels was good wheels!"
1479,"October 25, 2005 11:01AM",Mr_Shiftright,"the effect of the epa/dot on the individual car collector is really not the point or goal of the epa/dot. they are dealing with larger issues... but as they say ""when elephants dance, the ants get trampled"". i think americans can survive without their gray market cars just fine and really, having us all run around in 1960s era cars in the year 2005 probably isn't a good idea.

are we drifting topic here? i don't think so, since any ""project car"" you undertake had better conform to local and federal laws or you are totally screwed. i've seen so many horror shows that i really want to give people a heads up about ""weird"" cars."
1480,"October 25, 2005 11:27AM",fintail,"the old lady my mom knew also had a robins egg blue hornet. the thing was really in pristine condition...i remember seeing the car around 1994 or so, and it was really immaculate. the old lady's husband also had an old car - a 76 or so huge full size olds 2 door, in a creme yellow with a white vinyl top. it was also in nice condition, with like 60k on it. when he passed away, the car was sold for like $1000. i was almost tempted to look at it, but my dad said keep away based on the gas mileage and size. probably was a good idea.

onto the epa/dot silliness...dancing elephants indeed. the mere cost of shipment for oddball cars should keep the joker consumers out of the market - these things would be bought as hobby cars by enthusiasts, not regular commuters. there'd really be no harm done, but i am sure for those in charge, punch drunk on a power trip, it's hard to see the other side. not progressive people or ideas."
1481,"October 25, 2005 11:43AM",Mr_Shiftright,well you have smog rollbacks and some exceptions now for older cars. it could have been a lot worse.
1482,"October 25, 2005 11:54AM",jrosasmc,"does anybody remember the alliance/encore that amc made for renault in the us during the '80s? i swear those were probably the worst products ever to come out of that company. i've driven two of them and i was very unhappy after the drives...tinny, slow, noisy, shaky, etc."
1483,"October 25, 2005 11:55AM",andre1969,"do smog restrictions go, in general? there are still parts of maryland where no emissions test is required yet. it's mainly in low-population areas where the pollution associated with testing (having to build the facility in the first place- puts a strain on the environment, cars idling in long lines, etc) would probably exceed the savings of getting the gross polluters off the road. plus, they have to be able to support themselves. if you don't have enough car owners to cough up that $14.00 fee every two years, it's not going to be profitable.

in areas where the emissions test is required, cars from 1977-present are subjected, unless they're diesels or trucks over a certain gvwr. or, if you get historic tags on your car, which you can on 1980 and older cars (1981 as of january 1, 2006)"
1484,"October 25, 2005 12:18PM",Mr_Shiftright,"in california we are frozen at 1974 i believe...older than that and you are okay. diesels are still exempt.

so if you are buying in california or bringing a car into california you had better make sure the car is old enough or that will pass smog. some of the 80s carburetted cars are doomed in california...they just can't pass the test anymore.

in the sf bay area, cars are smog tested on dynos now."
1485,"October 25, 2005 12:28PM",andre1969,"they do that here in maryland, too. if the car's a '77-83 it does the old tailpipe test where they just rev it in park, but '84 and newer get put on the treadmill and they actually put it in drive and do a simulation run. supposedly the treadmill can hurt some of the older cars, but i don't know what would be different about say, an '83 monte carlo versus an '84 that would have any bearing.

wait, i just realized something...on the latest cars they just do an obd-ii scan and check for error codes. that actually pisses me off, because i want to see a printout to see how my car's really doing, not just the computer verifying that it's running okay! with my intrepid, i really wanted to see if, and how much the emissions deteriorated over the years."
1486,"October 25, 2005 1:09PM",xwesx,"speaking of memories......

i have to jump back to the dodge challengers. my mother had a pair of 1977 challengers for a while; one from new and purchased in alaska, the other used and purchased, i believe, in 1983. the alaska car was silver and the latecomer was blue. i fondly recall both vehicles because:

1) in 1982, not too long before my youngest brother was born (i think my mother was pregnant with him.... maybe 6 months?), we went garage-saling as we did every weekend. this was about hour 7 or 8 on the day and my brother and i, ages 4 and 5, respectively, were rather worn out. we ""waited in the car"" while my mother went to ""one last sale...."" well, waiting in the car consisted of pretending we were driving it. my brother managed to shift it into neutral and off we went down a hill. i told him ""pull up on that lever!"" and he did.... to no avail.... and the car eventually came to rest on top of a large hedge after it plummeted over a retaining wall. amazingly, the car suffered no real damage, at least not something a 4-year-old would notice when we drove away.

2) in 1984 my youngest brother (then 2 years and maybe 3 months old) pulls a similar stunt in the blue challenger. except this time the car is parked on the street and he is so small he cannot do anything to affect the car's movement, be it steer, brake, etc. my brother and i were charged with watching him, but we were in the back yard playing ball and he ""slipped away."" i tell you what, when we saw the car roll past us, you can bet we were watching real hard! three cars had to veer out of the way of the car as it slowly made its way across the road, and it finally was stopped by a neighbor's fence along the next block after it plowed down about 50' of newly painted picket fence and ground to a halt on top of the concrete base upon which the fence was built. again, the car was driven away from there, but i'd be amazed if it did not sustain some steering or suspension damage.

anyway, fun memories. in retrospect i am amazed and thankful that nobody was injured. those were tough cars for their size! :p"
1487,"October 25, 2005 1:11PM",martian,"i mean, everybody accepts that these cars were dogs when new-so is there a collector's market (of sorts) for these oddballs? i can't see that there is a parts supply for these things-junkyars would have crushed them long ago! still, there is a tv ad for some kind of new drug running-and it features a guy driving a lemon yellow gremlin! the gremlin was basically a sawed-off hornet-crappy hadling, crappy mileage, and a rust bucket to boot! where the heck did the ad agency dredge this car up?"
1488,"October 25, 2005 1:16PM",stickguy,"my gremlin didn't rust!

i would be happy to buy a clean v8 stick gremiln x if one came along. they really weren't bad cars for the day, compared to the rest of the crap out there. at least they were pretty tough."
1489,"October 25, 2005 1:17PM",xwesx,"when i had it registered in anchorage, i had to have an emissions test performed on my 1969! chevy pickup. in fairbanks, i think it is 1977, but no earlier than '74 for sure. in both places, the requirements must pass standards established for those years (i.e., a 1977 truck does not have to run as ""clean"" as a 2005), but must also pass a visual test. therefore, even if you have your 1985 full-size van with a 350 running as clean as a 2006 civic hybrid, if you do not have your air pump installed, you can hang it up! :p

with our cold winters, we get a lot of inversions that keep the pollutants near the ground. fairbanks used to be on the epa's blacklist! i think that wood-burning stoves are more the problem than autos, but both are monitored very closely."
1490,"October 25, 2005 1:25PM",qbrozen,"exactly what straight-6 are we talking about? the drivetrain in my amc jeep cj7 was, to my knowledge and opinion, quite overbuilt. by that i mean the 4.2 was indestructible, as were the axles. the 3-speed tranny eventually wore through the synchros, but a cheap rebuild later and it was good as new.

not to mention that engine was no speed demon, but supplied enough torque to spin the 32""x12"" tires from a standstill."
1491,"October 25, 2005 2:20PM",lemmer,"this mercedes isn't currently a project, but i would be afraid that it soon would become one. would anyone touch it?

1492,"October 25, 2005 2:48PM",ghulet,"you mean a project because of the miles? are 320s of that era straight or v-6? no matter, it could be a bit dicey, but 136k isn't that extreme for an eight year-old car, and the price is pretty tempting. not at all crazy about the color combo, and i'd have to see a carfax and repair records before i'd consider it.

funny, i test drove a manual transmission vigor about five or six years ago, and a '90-ish mercedes 190e 2.3 (automatic) the same day, i think they were the same price; i liked the vigor a bit better, it was kind of fun to drive (i'm sure the stick shift helped), sprightly, though not a powerhouse by today's standards. still, even with only 85k on the clock, an anomaly like a 5-cylinder acura that barely anyone even remembers isn't going to bring $7k on this planet, imo. i can think of a bunch of cars (foreign and domestic) on which i'd rather spend that kind of money."
1493,"October 25, 2005 2:58PM",fintail,"that clk is a v6. it's pretty cheap, but one would be well advised to find a lower mileage (and better colors) car for a little more, and maybe seek out a v8. i wouldn't look at it unless it was really pristine and had every record."

i know all about the ""easy fix"" syndrome (if it is so easy, why don't you do it), but bleeding the brakes? how much can that cost? just do the basic tune up, get the brakes up to snuff, drive it a few hundred miles, and skip the whole sitting around/needs stuff before you can drive it routine.

one thing though: the steering wheel is hideous. has to go."

1513,"October 26, 2005 10:16AM",andre1969,"the same thing as a fuel-injected carb? i know gm used to offer tbi on a lot of their cars back in the 80's, as kind of a stepping stone between carbs and pfi. and looking under the hood, the tbi setups i've seen look like carb setups."
1514,"October 26, 2005 10:43AM",qbrozen,"i believe its very similar ... but don't quote me on that. i know that, looking at them, they do appear similar (one injector suspended over each barrel of the carb), but i'm sure some engineer would have more detailed reasons for why they are not the same."

i had a friend whose dad worked at the body shop of one of the local chevy dealers. i remember when they bought a brand new '75 monte carlo ... except theirs was the metallic burnt orange rather than the green. stunning car, with a hood long enough to land cessnas onto.

not sure if they still own it, but i know they kept it for quite a number of years."

back in the 80's after she retired, my grandmother did part time transcription work for an old lady that had a '75 monte carlo. it was midnight blue with a white landau top and white vinyl interior. she smoked like a chimney, and for some reason reminded me of cruella devil. no dalmatian puppy coats for her, though...she was actually the president of the local spca!"

fin, i'm pretty sure, at least in the u.s., that the 300d non-turbo and turbo were not sold concurrently; the last year for the n/a was '81, with the turbo replacing it for '82. i think the same applies for the cd (coupe), but i'm not sure.

those various benzes you posted seem like relative bargains compared to this (and it even has a dent, and no mention of transmission or mileage). i think the high cost of gas has caused diesel owners to have fantasies about the value of the cars:

1537,"October 27, 2005 8:57AM",andre1969,"i spec'd a '74 out on nada, and with air conditioning, rally wheels, and a 4-speed, i got a high retail of around $18,000. now i don't believe that number for an instant! the gto faithful pretty much disowned the '74, and even the '73, which was still an intermediate with a nice, big 400, goes pretty much unloved, partly because the grand am took over as top dog.

still, for what it is, the '74 gto's not a bad little musclecar. 350-4bbl, 200 hp, compact body. 0-60 in 7.7 seconds according to one website i found. to put it in perspective, the original '64 gto with the base 389-4bbl and 325 gross hp was only good for around 7.5. plus, by then i think even cars like the grand am, regal gran sport, laguna s-3, and olds 442/hurst maxed out at around 250 hp, and they were much heavier cars than the '74 gto, so i doubt they were much faster.

and the last gasp that pontiac made at anything resembling a gto was the 1977 1/2 can am. the ads even proclaimed ""remember the goat"" and ""in the spirit of the gto"". it had a ""high performance"" 400 with 200 hp, a 15-20 hp boost over a normal 400 by then. but the car weighed around 4100 lb. 0-60 was around 8.6 seconds."

i'd guess that older m3s and m5s are equally pain to work on and equally troublesome, yes. most older ms i see are either real beaters or nice cars that have consumed cash well beyond their market value.

my two ""best buys"" in old sports cars are still the 78-83 porsche 911scs and the mazda rx-7 twin turbo. for $15k you get great looks, great performance and some looks from passersby at least. nobody but nuts like us would even notice an audi s4."

beat me with a fan belt but miatas and later alfas are kinda sorta ....um....more of a ladies car . having owned both i think this gives me dissin' rights. actually i like them both a lot, but they don't get to the viscera.

now an alfa gtv with competition head and good suspension, that would be a great project. not only will it slap a 90s alfa silly but being a coupe it has better rigidity and longevity....and it knows how to rev, too. and unlike miata, you don't see them all over the place.

we were discussing rallying at work today, and that brought memories of walter roehrl entering a 200 turbo quattro in a rally event when everyone else was driving tiny, nasty 4wd renaults... he came in 3rd.

awfully nice cars, and if you have a good mechanic or can do the work yourself, ultimately not so troublesome. depends on your pain threshold, i guess :-)

speaking of pain threshold; a buddy i don't often see anymore is leaving for ca... he's using his 5000 fwd sedan to pick up a quattro 5000 wagon... he just ""happens to have"" a towbar setup for 5000s... he's got 4 wagons, 4 q sedans, and one fwd sedan.... compared to him, andre is sane...

looks like production was around 6,000 for '94, 19,000 for '95, and 41,000 for '96. they only made around 100,000 total of this body for 1996, so when you factor out the roadmaster, fleetwood, caprice, and the roadmaster/caprice wagons, i'd imagine the ss was the most popular b-body that year. i think technically they still referred to the fleetwood as a d-body, but it was just a stretched out version."

impala ss: i've checked the auctions and it seems like you're right, it's the '96 model that brings the most interest. the trend seems to be, roughly, that the active range for nice ones is $12k, and that bidding pretty much starts to ""stall"" (that is, the cars begin to be ""not sold"") at around $15,000. there were a couple of ultra low miles cars (like 1,000 miles or 4,000 miles) that did apparently sell for around $23,000. also noted lots of customization.

1586,"October 28, 2005 10:35AM",fintail,"an early camaro is kind of like a model a/mgb/57 chevy - you can actually build one out of repro parts, right?"

1591,"October 28, 2005 12:44PM",Mr_Shiftright,"as they should be, following the law of supply and demand. they made a gazillion of them and now everyone who wants one new or used and can afford it or nearly afford it pretty much has one. so with buyers satisfied, price continues to drop."
1592,"October 28, 2005 12:49PM",lemmer,"i guess my thoughts were more along the lines that prices for early 968 convertibles and early boxsters overlap on ebay (even for some completed sales) and autotrader. it seems like that shouldn't happen as the boxsters are considered ""real"" porsches by most and 968s fall into the oddball camp (even though we all know that i love them). i would take the boxster, all else being equal."
1593,"October 28, 2005 7:25PM",fintail,"i kind of like these old beasts in an unexplainable way, but i bet this car is rusty. is that hp rating correct?

1594,"October 29, 2005 5:36AM",andre1969,"but yep, the chevy 400 only had 170 hp in 1972! kinda makes one wonder what the need was for it, since the 350 was putting out 165 hp that year in the big chevies, and the big-block 402 had 210 hp. there was a 240 hp version too, but it doesn't look like it was offered in the full-sized cars, only the intermediates and camaro. and at the top of the heap, the 454 was still pumping out 270 hp.

the 400 would've had more torque than the 350 though. it was standard in the caprice and station wagons that year, while the biscayne, bel air, and impala had the 250 inline 6 standard. only a handful of impalas were built with it, and here it was only offered in the 4 door sedan and hardtop coupe. the hardtop sedan and convertible had the 350 standard.

i guess chevy just never really thought about their 400 as a performance motor. in 1970 there were two hp ratings, 265 and 330 hp, but after that it seems it was mainly just a station wagon-type motor. ford was the same way in the 70's with their 400, though. in 1972 it only had 168-172 hp. seems like ford looked mainly to the 351 for performance, as even the 429 and 460 only put out in the low 200's.

pontiac used a 175 hp 400 in 1972, which was standard on the catalina wagon and catalina brougham. i forgot about the catalina brougham...what's the sense of offering something like that when you also have the bonneville and grand ville in your lineup? :confuse: this 400 was optional in other versions of the catalina, the lemans, and the firebird. however, pontiac did put out a 250 hp version of the 400, which was standard in the grand prix, optional in the firebird.

chrysler seemed to put a little more effort into their 400 that year, offering a 190 hp version as base, then a 250 hp version for the monaco/polara, and a 255 hp version for the charger.

oh yeah, i remember finding a road test of a '72 caprice hardtop coupe online awhile back, and i believe it had the 400. i think 0-60 was around 11.5 seconds. consumer reports tested a '72 impala sedan with the 350, and i think they got 0-60 in 12 seconds. those wagons were considerably heavier though, so i wouldn't expect one with the 400 to be as um, ""lively"" as those examples! :p"
1595,"October 29, 2005 5:57AM",steine13,"well, boys & girls,
i didn't get a new car after all. that 91 civic ran well -- following a jump start, anyway -- but the steering was a little loose, and the axles seemed to maybe bind a little, and the suspension was definitely shot. so there you have it, the proverbial $3000 thousand-dollar car, unless you can do it all yourself, which i don't have time for.

too bad, $1k isn't a bad price, with the body in very nice shape, a rebuilt tranny that is actually very nice 1 year later, and 209k on the clock. these little puppydogs fetch $800 on ebay with a blown engine :surprise:

oh well, less excitement, more garage parking.
meanwhile, i can't find any 15"" steelies to put snow tires on my vibe. sixteen-inch snows are kinda silly for a car like that. anybody got any ideas? i tried tirerack...

1596,"October 29, 2005 6:11AM",andre1969,"i had a little '91 civic for a rental car. it was a sedan...lx model i want to say. it had an optional engine, but i forget the hp. i want to say it was 100 or 108? i've heard that on these civics it's actually extremely cheap to replace the engine. supposedly there are plenty in supply. so i guess if you can find a good one with a bad engine, you might be better off than finding one with a good engine, but needs a ton of other work.

as for 15"" steel rims for the vibe, have you tried a local junkyard? i'd imagine that the vibe has the same wheel bolt pattern as the corolla and matrix."
1597,"October 29, 2005 7:05AM",british_rover,"there are kits to put everything from a 1.8 integra motor to a jdm (japanese domestic market) 2.2 honda prelude motor into 88-91 civics and crxs.

there was an article on sport compact car a few months ago and for about $8000 they built a crx that pulled more then a 1.0g on the skid pad and ran 13's or 12's on nitrous.

i really want to get a crx or civic of that year and make a beater rally car out of it. i could probably do that for less then $4000 since i don't need the nitrous or the crazy suspension and wheels that they put on this car."

some people find old decaying cars rather romantic but generally i have a more adverse reaction---if it was a nice and valuable car, i'm thinking that some dummy just let it rot out of laziness or greed, and if it's a worthless old car i wonder why they don't clean up their front yard."
1602,"October 29, 2005 2:05PM",ghulet,"....is actually a pretty good deal. '70s wagons are pretty hard to find, what with most of them having gone to the crusher twenty years or so ago and many of the 'survivors' going to the derbies; hopefully this one won't end up there, but at $500, i wouldn't be surprised.

this, on the other hand, is definitely not a 'good deal'.

1607,"October 30, 2005 3:06PM",british_rover,i wonder what year m3 motor they put in that 2002. i would imagine just about any one of those engines would over power that chassis.
1608,"October 30, 2005 3:18PM",Mr_Shiftright,"no kidding, and i hope they rebuilt it. m3 motors don't last all that long, they seem to fatigue quickly. maybe because people thrash them or perhaps because they are somewhat stressed.

i don't think it would be too hard to get proper tires on that 2002/m3, but what it really needs is wayyyyy better brakes before anything else is done to it.

it would be fun though even if you scared yourself a lot. :p"
1609,"October 30, 2005 3:42PM",stickguy,"given the size of the engine (physical), maybe they just went with the early 4 cyl. version? that wouldn't be too powerful for the chassis, certainly not too torquey!

i think it looked neat. probably a lot of fun, and no more scary than a frankenporsche."
1610,"October 30, 2005 4:29PM",jrosasmc,when discussing m3 motors here are we talking about the e30 models (1988-91) or the e36 (1995-99)?

1614,"October 31, 2005 6:47AM",british_rover,"i agree they probably used the e30 4 cyl m3 motor and not the 6 cyl one since i doubt it would fit.

that motor is probably the least civilized of the m3 family though since those cars were the closes m3 to a pure race car sold for street driving."
1615,"October 31, 2005 7:34AM",lemmer,"when the early m3s were new, i remember reading articles stating that a 325is was almost just as fun to drive and it was a far better car overall. it seems like the m3 would be far more expensive to buy and keep running, but some people have bestowed them with some sort of legendary status. kinda like the hemi v. wedgie thing with mopars."

by the way, before people call me an idiot about 2-door sedans:

main entry: se·dan
pronunciation: si-'dan
function: noun
a 2- or 4-door automobile seating 4 or more persons and usually having a permanent top

my rule of thumb is if you can't tell if it is a 2 or 4 door from a silouhette, it is a sedan."

1623,"October 31, 2005 10:15AM",lemmer,"if you are going to pimp it out that much, how about a little more power. a new cam isn't going to compensate for all of the extra weight of the electronics, bigger wheels, etc. i assume the thing was no ""bahn burner"" in stock form.

i know the car is italian, but i just like saying ""bahn burner."" in the '80s, that term appeared at least twice in every issue of motor trend, car & driver, and r&t. kinda like now, nothing is old technology; it is ""antediluvian,"" and cars don't have wheels and/or tires; they have ""rolling stock."" is there some kind of car magazine thesaurus that every writer is forced to use?"
1624,"October 31, 2005 10:16AM",Mr_Shiftright,"""known to go 300k""

known by whom? that's a pretty fanciful statement. case in point, go to a bimmer wrecking yard and read the odometers. you won't see any with 300k i'll wager.

180k?? car could be very tired----but if it tests out all right, might be worth $3,500 but really more like $2,500. the automatic 6s are kind of dogs and they suck a lot of gas but in spite of his hyperbole he is right, they are nice cruising cars. i don't know where he got the impression that they were fast however---well, compared to what i guess.

missing catalytic is a big minus, that'll screw you in many states. at least you'll have to buy a spare one to keep in the garage so that you can sell the damn car if you don't like it.

might be an okay car if you can get the price down more. it's not nice enough for $4k, not at all."
1625,"October 31, 2005 10:43AM",andre1969,"is a relative term i guess. i have an old 1985 consumer guide car book, and they tested a 6-series coupe. i think it had 182 hp, and i know the one they tested was a stick. it was one of the fastest cars from 0-60 in that book. i can't remember the time, though. for the most part, that book tested ordinary family cars, economy cars, and stuff like that, and by and large the most exotic you'd see in that book was a mustang gt, mark vii lsc, or a camaro iroc. they did have a jag xj-s in it, though.

how bad would the automatic hurt performance, versus the stick?"
1626,"October 31, 2005 10:44AM",lemko,i had the station wagon version of that 1968 buick skylark in that same color with a white roof. the interior of that car is also similar to my old car.
1627,"October 31, 2005 11:00AM",Mr_Shiftright,"it's probably an 8 second car, 0-60 and maybe 9 seconds with an automatic. for its size, fairly spritely but most modern japanese 4-door sedans would easily keep up.

the one you want is the m88 euro motor with 4 valves and 288 hp.

also driving those big bimmer coupes with a stick shift is a real chore. it's a gt car, not a sports car."

the ride itself is a lot harsher than the 126 in town, but is fine on the highway. funny thing...when i had the fintail and the 126, the 126 was so smooth and relaxed, and the fintail loud and rough. now the fintail is smooth and floaty, and the c43 much more taut."

then, what about the '77-79 caprice/impala? the '80-90 was just a re-skin that lowered the front, raised the rear, and made the coupes more upright. i wonder if mtv just got sloppy, or if there's really some reason the gangsta and rappers and playas just don't like the '76 or '77-79? or am i thinking too much into this? :p"

also the vin # says it is a 1958 model and the engine is from a 1960 car.

interior looks nice enough and it has the nifty optional carrera hubcaps.

hard to say but i think the bid is already too much for the car....figure floorpan work and engine rebuild you are in $15,000, so you've paid $12.5k + $15k----shoot, just go buy one already done for that money. value if floor has rust and engine is tired and non matching #s??? i'd bid the car at about $7,500 fair price to all concerned. if engine checks out fine (good compression, etc), let's say $10k-$12k.

mach 1 -- agreed, overpriced for a 351 automatic. you should be able to find a clean driver for $20k in today's market, a show car for $35k, so his price is loony-bin. if it were a 428, it would be worth it, since such a car restored can top $50k. the math is obvious...you can't get from where this car is to a show car for $25,000 and you can't get to a clean daily driver for $12,000. in pure cold numbers, the car is essentially a parts car worth $3,500."

1654,"November 3, 2005 11:08AM",Mr_Shiftright,"ah, well, i think you may be mis-reading what nada means by low retail:

""low retail value
this vehicle would be in mechanically functional condition, needing only minor reconditioning. the exterior paint, trim, and interior would show normal wear, needing only minor reconditioning. may also be a deteriorated restoration or a very poor amateur restoration. most usable ""as-is"".""

well then low retail is a complete driveable decent-looking car with some obvious needs---but you could drive it home....so how does this wreck qualify as having the same value?

it don't imho.

if you got this car for free you'd hardly make out. we've got rusted floors, doors and 1/4 panels, we need engine, interior, paint and apparently brake work.

there's nothing here worth $8,500 bucks.

i mean, they made over 72,000 of these things in 1969---this is not a rare car by any mean.

i found a couple on autotrader that looked like decent drivers for $15,000.

this is a #5 car to my mind, not a ""low retail"" car. so grade 4 doesn't even apply, as a #4 is also driveable.

old car price guide puts a #4 at $5,800, so i'd put a fair market value #5 at around $3,500.

body work $3k
paint $3k
engine $4k
interior $2k

okay we are in $20k and we haven't even touched the suspension brakes, tranny, rear end, tires, chrome and glass. that's another $12k easy.

better to just go buy a nice one."
1655,"November 3, 2005 11:14AM",au94,"no, no, i should have clarified, i would never pay 8500 for this car. 5k should be the sellers dream sale. i'd start at 2500 and go up to 3500 max. these are ticking up a few % points each year so i think you could make a few grand off it. as long as you didn't lose your head and do a complete frame off, better than new restoration with a 35 coat chip foose paint job.

and i'll admit, i'm a mustang guy. i'd hate to see ol' paint put down"
1656,"November 3, 2005 11:55AM",fintail,"well, it's a period color....future low rider maybe"
1657,"November 3, 2005 12:38PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well maybe you could buy it cheap and just stuff it in the back 40 until the day when it is worth restoring (if ever). but you know, you start with a pile of junk and you end up with a pile of junk --sometimes even if you spend a lot of money.

rust is pernicious, it's very hard to stop and it can come back to haunt your restoration."
1658,"November 3, 2005 12:53PM",au94,"you are probalby right, but without seeing it i would not write it off. it's still a classic mustang and a mach 1 at that.

one thing i am sure of, it will sell and it will sell for too much $$."
1659,"November 3, 2005 1:10PM",Mr_Shiftright,"given the description, which is invariably better than real life, i would write it off. it's not that rare a mustang---72,000 for one year is a lot of cars, and it's not a 428 or a 4-speed. there are mach 1s and there are mach 1s.

i'm not so sure it will sell for anything close to asking. collector car buyers are a lot smarter than they were 10 years ago. a mach 1 buyer knows the market. of course you might get the buyer who's dad had the same color car and maybe he was born in the back seat, etc., so sentimentality will overrule common sense. it happens."

1670,"November 4, 2005 6:07AM",andre1969,"is one reason that i really prefer the toronado and riviera version of these '79-85 e-bodies. the eldo looks nice on the outside, but that button-tufted look is just too much. for the most part i think buicks stayed away from those buttons, but oldmobiles and chryslers sure seemed to have a fetish for them."
1671,"November 4, 2005 7:23AM",lemmer,"that model actually came with wings and spoilers, and they are worth waaay more a plain jane 190. i kind of like them, but they money there is a lot of stuff i like more."

1673,"November 4, 2005 8:51AM",lemko,you're right. my 1985 chrysler fifth avenue had a red interior like that. i loved it! that eldo's interior looks so inviting! too bad it's got such a crappy engine.
1674,"November 4, 2005 9:03AM",andre1969,"but that '74 4-4-2 should have a 455. i'd guess 250 hp, tops."
1675,"November 4, 2005 9:23AM",fintail,"very nice looking 126, but yeah, the nicest sedans aren't worth much more than 10k us anymore, and that's for the best of the last 560sels, not earlier cars like that one. that car could bring maybe 7-8k to a mb enthusiast, few others would be brave enough to face the maintenance.

the 2.3-16 is less overpriced (but it still is), and does look nice. good use of evo wheels, it just needs an evo spoiler."
1676,"November 4, 2005 9:26AM",andre1969,"that's another reason that i preferred the toro/riv to the eldorado. with the toro/riv you usually got an olds v-8. i think the 350 was standard in '79, and the 307 might have been standard for '80 with the 350 being optional. from '81-85 the 307 was what went into most of them, although the buick 4.1 v-6 was standard, and the dreaded diesel was always an option. a couple years you could get the 3.8 turbo in the riv, but in the heavier body i'm sure it wasn't the rocket it was in the grand national!

now the earlier eldos weren't bad, as the '79 had the olds 350 and the '80 had the caddy 368. but i think diesels were more prevalent in the caddies, the 1981 v-8-6-4 was troublesome, and the '82-85 aluminum 4.1 was an underpowered nightmare!

as for the pimpy buttoned seats, i actually kinda like them in the chryslers. there was just something about the leather that seemed supple and inviting. as i recall, the leather in the '79-85 eldorado was firmer, and more akin to the type of antique furniture that your grandparents would throw a plastic cover over!"

i rather envy people who are content to drive cars at 80% efficiency. it's like when i go to the ballpark. there i am worried about saturated fat and right next to me is this fat guy cramming nachos and 24 oz pepsis and 55 gallon drums of peanuts and dancing to really bad disco music and watching the worst team in baseball and having a great time. there's something liberating about not having high standards, you know?

jaserb, ""project cars: you get to vote on ""hold 'em or fold 'em"""" #530, 22 apr 2005 10:44 am

it's currently in my garage, waiting for me to cut out the last few spot welds holding the driver's side floor in. the interior is out and in boxes, and i've sourced most of the parts i need to replace to get it in the shape i want it. i was very happy with the overall lack of rust on the car. just the front driver floorpan to worry about, all the rockers / wheel wells are rock solid.

i've sorted out some mechanical issues, the biggest of which was that it needed a rebuilt spica pump, which was a chunk of change. i added some euro cams at the same time and that really gave it a kick. after buying pretty much all the stuff i needed, some stuff that was probably frivolous (like a really nice set of aftermarket wheels and tires on ebay that i just had to have), and selling a bunch of extra parts i'm right around the $4k mark.

so once i get my neighbor to come over with his mig and weld the new floor in i'm ready for paint. i'm hoping i can get a decent paint job in the $2-3k range if i do some of the prep work. the goal here is to be ready for top down driving in the spring, but i have a lot of work to do to get there.

here are the wheels:


-jason"
1694,"November 4, 2005 6:13PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i really like two-tone fintail cars...it cuts down the bulkiness/boxiness of the profile...i think they are very cute in fact.

alfa spider -- well now, if it really is in ""near show condition"" the price is possible to achieve. ($6,200).

63 corvette -- well i dunno about this bidding...seems like you can get a pretty nice one of these for $50k or so, and this being an automatic, without power steering (grunt), and needing quite a bit of work still, i'm not sure how pleasant this will be to drive around. probably destined to be a trailer queen i'd imagine (sigh...). personally, i'd swap out a p/s box and a 4-speed and authenticity be damned on this baby. i bet i'd get more for it ""revised"" than stock!

jaserb -- i like those wheels! the euro cams are a good idea -- i hope they give you a little more mid-range grunt."
1695,"November 4, 2005 6:57PM",jaserb,"new wheels probably should have been the last things i bought, but these were so good looking. i had decided on panasports but those are almost as common on these cars as the original wheels. these wheels i bought are alfa specific, made in italy by oz, and i've never seen another set.

1702,"November 6, 2005 1:58PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well as i've probably mentioned before, the value of a car has nothing to do with its ""merit"" or looks or anything else. it's a supply and demand equation. there are more of them for sale than people that want them, so the price goes down until people start ""biting"".

think of pricing like a pyramid. at the very top or point is the highest price and you can see that there's very little room up there in the pyramid penthouse (few buyers can fit into it).

as you lower the price, there is more room for more buyers to jump in.

for this '76 olds, the seller has set the price right at the tippy top of the pyramid and he's not going to get many people in there.

for a more popular old car, like a hemi cuda', even they have pyramids, but the tip of the price point is wayyyyy higher of course.

look at it another way...1976 is when most collectors have already lost interest in the cars of this time period...the dark ages are from about 1974--1980 something.

you have to price cars in this time period realistically because supply currently outstrips demand.

this is true for a pontiac a porsche or a ferrari."

even with most of the old cars i've had, i've actually missed most of the excesses of the '70's. i've had a '69 bonneville on one end, and two '79 full-sized chryslers on the other, but the only vehicle i've had from the era of peak excess is my '76 lemans, and it's a mere dinghy compared to some of those loveboats from the era! the bonneville could actually carry itself well, and the two chryslers were beefed up, and so was the lemans, so i've never really had the pleasure of experiencing one of those truly big boats in all of their wallowing glory."

they're actually pretty comfy inside, too. the seats are low to the floor, and there's not an abundance of headroom, but there's plenty of room to stretch my legs out. basically, it's a car that you drive in a reclined position, something like piloting your livingroom around while relaxing in one of those old 70's overstuffed lay-z-boy recliners. after riding in the back seat a couple times though, i learned first-hand how people used to get car-sick in those old boats."

how many cars with a bad frame (actually, so bad that they would note it in the ad, vs. the usualy ignore it and figure the buyer won't notice) are worth taking on as a project? i just don't see any upside on that one."
1713,"November 7, 2005 9:03AM",lemko,"what a shame! i'd be desperately afraid of a convertible with a bad frame. the only solution i could think of outside of getting a convertible in better condition is finding a junked hardtop or a convertible in worse shape but a good frame, detaching the body, and slinging the good frame underneath."
1714,"November 7, 2005 9:11AM",andre1969,"1961 is probably my favorite year for pontiacs of the '60's. however, the part about the ""bad frame"" bothers me. and there's just too much rust in general. i guess you might be able to salvage some of the interior, glass, maybe some mechanical/suspension parts?

that actually is a pretty valuable car. nada lists a ""high retail"" of around $47,000 (i spec'd it with a/c and the 303 hp 389 v-8). in comparison, they list a ""high retail"" of my '67 at around $17,000. i'm sure that both of those prices are a bit optimistic though, and if someone offered me $17k for mine it'd be sold in a heartbeat!

you can ask an exceptional price on any car, but only for an exceptional (as in once in a blue moon) price.

1720,"November 7, 2005 1:20PM",xwesx,"yeech. i can see that being a sharp car if restored, but i personally would not touch that one. it has been literally rotting for far too long. it would be a good parts car though. the interior looks to have some nice ""treasures."" it would have to be worth a whole heck of a lot once restored to be worth the effort. it was probably far easier to build the prototype of this car than it would be to rebuild this one."
1721,"November 7, 2005 1:34PM",fintail,"yeah, and the green universal is a solid honest car - i've seen it in person many times. his reserve is at least 15k...i don't know how serious he is about selling it, rather than just wanting to test the market.

the universal cult is pretty crazy, so i could see a real rusty beater bring a few grand at least."
1722,"November 7, 2005 2:55PM",Mr_Shiftright,"a person is just flushing money down the toilet buying a rusty old benz, except to snag a few parts off it. at best, he ends up buried up to twice the value and at worst he patches it up and foist it off on someone who doesn't know better. i just looked at a bmw 2002 like that for someone and saved them a lot of grief i think. bondo, pop riveted sheet metal and lots of goopy undercoating."
1723,"November 7, 2005 3:09PM",lemmer,a gaggle of 914s - your best bet might be to part out the junkers and sell their carcasses on ebay. maybe you could get lucky and be able to keep the runner for free.

1727,"November 8, 2005 7:27AM",lemmer,"a 944 turbo that looks pretty good, but needs some mechanicals.

if you could buy it for maybe $2000 or so, you might be able to come out ok. but i bet he has neglected the service. maybe it needs a timing belt and a clutch; then you are in over your head.

this 944 is ""turnkey"" but it leaks oil, has a little body damage, needs some interior work, etc. i mainly included this one so you can all read the creepy comment and reply at the bottom. people typically post questions and answers so that other prospective buyers might get some useful information. not this person.

$15k for a salvage sc with needs. no."
1728,"November 8, 2005 7:32AM",lemko,...what would something unusual like an early-mid 1960s mercedes ambulance fetch if the universal is so revered? i remember matchbox had a really cool replica of a m-b ambulance back in the day.
1729,"November 8, 2005 8:33AM",stickguy,"you are a brave man, swimming in this pool of interesting old porsches.

the red 944 sounds like it might be ok if you get it at a good price. of course, why is it in nc with maryland plates?

the white one could go either way. you really need a very sharp 944 expert to look at it carefully. i bet the owner knows more about the extent of the problems then they are letting on.

the 911 looks real nice. wonder why it was salvaged? that vintage is about my favorite 911 (i think it is what shifty recommends too). but, for a car with a bad title and no records, it would have to be an awful cheap price (say, i'll give him 5k if it drive ok)."

that e320 is pretty beat considering most of those late series ones were pampered. i wouldn't pay a premium for it.

1739,"November 9, 2005 8:02AM",lemmer,"a lot of money in this focus, not that he'll get it back."
1740,"November 9, 2005 8:17AM",andre1969,"kinda reminds me of the '53 desoto firedome my granddad had when i was a kid, which he sold right around my 16th birthday. i had my heart set on that car, but his rationale for getting rid of it was that he didn't want me driving around in some old car that i'd bring back to him to fix every time something broke. so, i ended up with my mom's '80 malibu which, you guessed it...i brought to him every time something broke! :p

i doubt a '54 windsor would go for much, especially being a 4-door and having the flathead 6. if i were to take a wild guess, i'd say maybe $6-7,000 in like-new condition? and then there are only so many people lusting after something like that."
1741,"November 9, 2005 8:55AM",au94,not to mentionthe fact that it is ugly with a capital u. 5500 is a nice price for a used focus though. sans modifications it would make a great commuter car or a car for a college bound person.
1742,"November 9, 2005 9:03AM",andre1969,"instead of doing all that crap to the basic little 2.0 engine, wouldn't they have been better off putting in the bigger, stronger 2.3 and working from there?"
1743,"November 9, 2005 9:29AM",lemmer,"you are right, but young people seem to modify whatever is in front of them. the car was probably a hand-me-down from his mom or sister or something."
1744,"November 9, 2005 10:22AM",lemmer,"this seems like a good deal on an ml320. i know they had all kinds of issues when new, but i wonder how they do long term. most of the ones on ebay have like new interiors regardless of mileage.

clean one owner 280zx. i kinda like this one.

decent looking '63 impala."
1745,"November 9, 2005 10:45AM",fintail,"yeah that chrysler might be worth 7k in exceptional condition, and it will take more than 7k to bring it there, unless you can source cheap parts, do all the work yourself, and also do paint and interior work. the guy doesn't even say it runs...although i do like the idea of aquamarine tinted glass. there was light green tinted glass offered on fintails, although i have never seen it.

that ml is a gamble. it's a very early model, boy do they somehow seem spartan inside, and the bumpers are not flattering. they were indeed bug-filled, but i think they got sorted out over time. one sees a lot of them out there, so they must be at least ok."
1746,"November 9, 2005 11:25AM",Mr_Shiftright,"'52 chrysler plain jane 4-door windsor really has no collector car value at all...it's just an old car, so you value it based on what is a 50 year hunk of iron worth? price of $750 seems plenty as it sits. i'd guess a very clean survivor maybe $2,500 tops. nobody wants these is the problem.

now if it were the '52 windsor wagon, you could get some serious money for it, like fintail is talking about, but for this old 4-door....not likely imo. i've seen too many of this era/type fail to bring a single bid at auction."
1747,"November 9, 2005 2:06PM",xwesx,"hahah.... that minor rear-ending rendered the car ""undriveable??"" shoot, i see cars here driving every day with 10x that amount of damage.

apparently he wants you to pay 10k or more for a 20-yr-old ""modified"" tin can. that's just too good of a deal to pass up!!!! :p"
1748,"November 9, 2005 2:19PM",xwesx,"the description says ""tires and wheels are scratched."" tires.... what tires?! there is a lot of wheel there, though! yeech. the paint is pretty, but i could do without pretty much all the other ""improvements.""

the person seems realistic with way too big of a pocketbook. $5500 seems reasonable for this car if he finds someone who wants it with all those changes."
1749,"November 9, 2005 4:08PM",andre1969,"i'm guessing the reason that it's not driveable is that something got pushed just far enough to interfere with the suspension travel? or maybe the exhaust got crimped to the point that it makes too much backpressure?

it really doesn't look like much damage, but on these tiny cars with no rear overhang, even the slightest bump can disable them."
1750,"November 9, 2005 4:27PM",Mr_Shiftright,probably a frame tweak or a slight buckle in the roof that you can't see. cars hit in that way are often torqued like that.
1751,"November 9, 2005 6:57PM",fintail,i could see andre driving this
1752,"November 9, 2005 7:08PM",Mr_Shiftright,"does ""tlc"" stand for tremendous loads of cash?

this car probably isn't worth restoring actually. you should be able to find a very nice one for $10,000 and the world's best for $15000 and you aren't going to get paint, top, interior and mechanicals for anything near that. since it isn't rare, why take on a poor example like this one?

of course, you could think of it as an installment plan restoration i suppose, (with heavy interest).

remember this type of car is no less expensive to restore than a cadillac eldo or an impala ss convert. and you have a car worth twice as much (with the ss, not the cadillac)."
1753,"November 9, 2005 7:11PM",fintail,i like how it's missing the rear window...a great feature when we just had like 12 straight days with rain
1754,"November 9, 2005 7:14PM",Mr_Shiftright,"that's why i was figuring a whole new interior (leather maybe?) and top mechanism. the whole car screams ""i don't care about it!""

you know it doesn't take a lot to buy a hi-tech cover, drain the block, fill the interior with bags of drying agent, plug the air filter and tail pipe and put 300 lbs of air in the tires. i mean, at least try to help the car."
1755,"November 9, 2005 7:18PM",gsemike,what's the point of that open hood shot with the pile of parts on top of the engine? he would have been better leaving the hood closed for now.
1756,"November 9, 2005 7:21PM",xwesx,"that was actually the trunk..... probably to illustrate the ""i have extra parts!"" statement in the text. not that what we see would ""sweeten"" the deal much!

or, maybe to assure the observer that there was not a body (or two) in there.... the real motive for trying to get rid of this car! :p"
1757,"November 9, 2005 7:25PM",Mr_Shiftright,"it's a $500 car at best and even then i'm not sure if it would pay for itself in parts. most restorers don't use old junk anyway, they want nos or repos."
1758,"November 10, 2005 6:44AM",andre1969,"can you easily get nos or reproduction stuff for something like a '65 electra? i know you could practically build something like a '65 mustang or '65 impala from the ground up just on nos and repros, but with that electra wouldn't you be more relegated to scrounging the junkyards and swap meets in the hopes of finding the parts you need?

there's a '65 electra convertible at a repair shop not too far from my house for sale, in a similar color to that one. i think they wanted $3500 for it. i want to say it had a rebuilt 430 v-8 mated to a thm350. is a thm350 strong enough for an engine like that? i'm sure that it originally would've had a thm400. i don't think the 350 came out until later, and then it was mainly an intermediate/smallblock type of tranny. the one in my neighborhood looks better than the '65 fintail posted in every respect except one...rust-out around the rear wheel openings."
1759,"November 10, 2005 8:05AM",lemmer,"i really like this bmw, but is seems really overpriced to me.

look at this mercedes. it looks like the taxis lined up in front of every european airport."
1760,"November 10, 2005 8:12AM",andre1969,seeing a benz stripped down that far. i kinda like that striped cloth interior. isn't that kinda pricey for something that old?
1761,"November 10, 2005 8:56AM",au94,man are you right about that mercedes. i've even been in some across the pond that have vinyl interior.
1762,"November 10, 2005 9:17AM",lemmer,a ton of mercedes and bmws here in the usa have vinyl interiors. it is hard to tell their stuff from leather.
1763,"November 10, 2005 9:29AM",andre1969,"offer different grades of vinyl? i know they have that ""mb-tex"" or whatever it's called, which is very high quality. and i think bmw has some equivalent. but in europe, perhaps they offer a cheaper grade of vinyl?"
1764,"November 10, 2005 9:45AM",fintail,"the biodiesel nuts here would be drooling over that 250d. that's kind of a cool car, i like it. and as far as i know, mb has but one grade of vinyl, that being mb-tex. it's an excellent material, lasts for decades and does a passable leather imitation.

cute pair

so what's it worth? 25k? it's not a frame-off or something. give me a break"
1765,"November 10, 2005 11:07AM",fintail,"unusual cheap beater

these sure held value poorly"
1766,"November 10, 2005 11:34AM",Mr_Shiftright,"'67 gto convertible --- price is totally stupid. hemmings muscle cars price guide (and they oughta know) says $30k on the very high end. this car may not even have correct #s. even $25k would be a strong price but reachable. pity the fool who pays $45k for an automatic 335hp model.

90 infiniti --- really boring car, but for the money, not bad at all....

saab convertible -- well the car has issues but the price doesn't reflect that quite enough. the $4,200 should be the price for an average car with 100k miles with no problems, but when you think about the bad muffler (you know it's more than just a muffler), the leaky convertible back window (typical), the balky tonneau mechanism (can that be cheap? noooooooo), the need for the dashboard to be torn apart to get at the electrics,a ripped up interior well gee, what have you got here? value? $2,500 all day long if he's lucky.

deal with it---if you own a saab or jaguar ten years old, you are going to get pounded on resale big time because these cars tend to nickel and dime you to death over time and everybody out there knows that."
1767,"November 10, 2005 12:36PM",au94,"no, i mean thin, plain black, no texture vinyl. not the ""leatherette"" this is clearly low grade stuff made just for taxis so it can be replaced periodically."
1768,"November 10, 2005 12:52PM",andre1969,"police/taxi only type of vinyl? kinda like what used to be common on police/taxi spec gran furys, diplomats, caprices, crown vics, etc here? that cheap, yet thick stuff like what they use to cover school bus seats with?"

1771,"November 10, 2005 4:04PM",andre1969,"those eagles were actually pretty expensive new. nicely equipped, it wasn't hard to get them up to around $16-17k, which was a lot of money back then. for comparison, my grandparents bought a new lesabre limited in '85 for around $16,200 out the door, and a nicely equipped silverado for around $13,500. heck, i think the first acura legends were only around $20,000!

oh, and with the 258-6 and 4wd, expect 0-60 in around 17-18 seconds. i don't know the value of that amc today, but i hope nobody tries to outbid the shill who started it off at $3,000! :p now granted, it does look like it's in nice shape, and low miles, so i guess if someone really had to have this car, maybe $4,000 tops?"

i never minded that t-bird either. odd that it was a mere 2 year style. i wonder if those had the same self-destruct trannys as period taurus, as i am sure the v6 birds had the same powertrain. i also recall that bird with a 4cyl turbo and i am pretty sure a v8 too."
1779,"November 11, 2005 1:42PM",jaserb,"i drove around my cousin's turbo t-bird for a while, i think it was an '87. it had a switch on the dash that would set the ignition timing / boost / etc. based on the octane of gas you were using. it was decently quick set to regular, but switch it to premium and it was really fast for the time, in spite of some pretty serious turbo lag.

i wonder how many of those motors blew up when folks put in regular but set it for premium... :sick: probably not something you want the driver to be able to control.

-jason"
1780,"November 11, 2005 6:59PM",Mr_Shiftright,i think the casualty rate for turbo t-birds was pretty high but i doubt the boost level had anything to do with it. it wasn't boosted very high as i recall (for good reasons as it turned out).
1781,"November 11, 2005 7:17PM",jrosasmc,if i recall correctly the turbo t-birds had bad build quality which probably contributed to their early demise.
1782,"November 11, 2005 7:49PM",Mr_Shiftright,"most 80s turbo technology was rather mediocre. it's gotten so much better now. 80s turbos are basically kaboom cars--t-bird, dodge, saab.... except maybe porsche, who did it right....but of course early porsche turbos had some vicious lag, which often sent their high profile newbie drivers into trees and guardrails.

now they have all these slick turbos, and twin turbos and they really work well without overstressing the engine."
1783,"November 12, 2005 5:25AM",andre1969,"the '87-88 t-bird, too. being rwd, i don't think it would've had the same tranny problems as the taurus. i'd imagine that it used the same tranny that the crown vic had in it. that particular t-bird looks fairly basic, too...base-level interior, column shift. i imagine it's just a v-6.

now the v-6 is something you might have to watch out for, being the 3.8 that tends to blow its head gasket around 90,000 miles.

as for turbos, i know this is only a sample of one, but the 2.2 turbo i in my ex-wife's '88 lebaron finally blew around the 115,000 mile mark. that car had been stolen on several occasions, and while i'd like to think that the joy riders were gentle on it, i have a feeling that's not the case! :p the ex- could get a bit rough on it, too.

one problem with turbos back then is you had to let them cool down. after driving one for awhile you weren't supposed to just park it and turn it off...you were supposed to let them idle for a bit first. unfortunately, most people didn't know that back then. do you still have to let modern turbos cool down, or has that issue been addressed?"
1784,"November 12, 2005 9:35AM",british_rover,you should really let them idle for a little while to extend their life to the fullest. the aftermarket does make turbo timers that are installed into the car. you park the vehicle take the key out and walk away and the computer will idle the car for 1-2 minutes and then shut it off automaticly. that is enough time for the turbos to spool down and they cool off.
1785,"November 12, 2005 11:22AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i think if you let them cool down you can extend their life but most people don't do that and the turbos today seem to hold up for at least as long as most people hold onto cars.

if you are buying a turbo ""project car"" there are tell-tale signs of turbo wear....two things that come to my mind are of course excessive turbo ""whine"" and also puffs of blue smoke when you start the car that go away after a while.

overall though, i think a turbo engine, even a new one, loses about 10% life expectancy to a n/a engine. you don't get something for nothing.

but you shouldn't let a bad turbo deter you from a good buy on a car you like. turbos can be rebuilt very economically and usually they aren't too hard to remove. it's really all plumbing and rusty bolts, not rocket science---the rebuilders do the science part you just do the plumbing.

cost to rebuild? maybe $300-$500 for a nice job."
1786,"November 12, 2005 1:08PM",jsylvester,"i never had a single problem with the turbo in my 87 sundance when i unloaded it at 106,000 miles. didn't use any oil or coolant either.

now, the rest of the car was crap."
1787,"November 12, 2005 1:55PM",andre1969,"wasn't a bad car, up until around the 90,000 mile mark. after that? well, i guess about the most polite way to put it is that the car went ""[non-permissible content removed] up""!

my uncle had bought it used in april of '90, but ended up not driving it much because it was too low for him to get into and out of. i forget how many mile he had on it when he bought it, but when he sold it to us in the summer of '95, i think it had around 75,000 miles on it. he'd had problems with the trip computer, and i think the turn signal switch had actually fallen off at one point, but nothing really catastrophic went bad on it.

at 90,000 miles, we had the timing belt changed (really shoulda been done at 60k...oops! :blush: ) it also needed cv boots or half-shafts or something to do with the fwd setup...in the end it ran around $1000 to fix, total. soon after that we split up, and i let her have the lebaron.

while it was under her ""care"", it ended up needing a new radiator. and a few other things i've probably forgotten about. the a/c compressor died on her...froze up and actually sent some shrapnel flying! i took off the belt for her. power antenna broke. trip computer started going bad again and literally lied through its teeth...would tell you that you had 200 miles to empty as you ran out of gas! the turbo died. and then it blew a head gasket. she took it to someplace her mother found, and they put on a new gasket and a used head for around $750, but it ran like crap. i talked her into letting me borrow it and take it to my mechanic. he got it running semi-correctly again. it turned out that most of the vacuum lines and wires on top of the head were either not hooked up or hooked up wrong. it didn't run too bad once my guy fixed it, but he warned us not to put another dime into it. he said compression was shot in two cylinders, and weak in the other two, and that it was on its deathbed.

at around the 115,000 mile mark, the ex- sold it back to me for the cost of a ticket to go see faith no more at some local club, which was 90 bucks. it made it back to my place under its own power, barely, and i sold it for parts. the body on it was very good, and so was the interior. it had these nice alloy wheels too, and the 3-speed automatic tranny still worked fine (about the only thing on the car that did) although the pan had a leak in it where it looked like it rusted through (odd...i thought it would've been aluminum. oh well, aluminum can still corrode)

i guess in the late 80's the old addage ""they don't build 'em like they used to"" still held true. thank god they've improved since those dim dark days. my intrepid is pushing 112,000 miles, about the same point that lebaron did it's suicide dance, yet the intrepid feels like it's got plenty of life left in it. i just hope it doesn't go ""[non-permissible content removed] up"" around 115k like the lebaron did! :p"

it sounds like it's got a nice motor. i think i see some alignment problems on the body panels. i guess that you've got to be concerned with what's not mentioned such as the floors and interior and what exactly from the body is missing.

since the car isn't super desirable, what is the high end moneywise?"
1789,"November 13, 2005 10:22PM",stickguy,"does seem to have potential, but craigs is even harder to tell from than ebay, where you sometimes get decent pictures.

don't like the wheels though, and it would be nice to see the interior.

price might be ok if it really only need final prep and paint. but, you you said, if you got this close, why not finish it? you would think that the cars value would go up even more than the cost of the paint? if not, no one should buy it.

imo (since you asked), i think the most likely reasons they sell after all that work are a) they are broke (or need money for something else), or b) their so is tired of the junker in the driveway ans wants it gone. or, some combo of the 2!"
1790,"November 14, 2005 6:51AM",gsemike,"i agree about the wheels. they look like something that would have been put on an 85 camaro with a 6 cyl. they're probably $49 a piece of so. for a driver, you still can't go wrong with some nice center lines.

i would think that it's getting dumped as is because it was supposed to be done for the summer and the guy doesn't have garage spot for it now that the summer has come and gone and the weather is turning bad.

if the interior and underpinnings are decent, picture it with a nice black paint job and some center lines. that would be sharp."
1791,"November 14, 2005 8:22AM",lemmer,"me likes the 944 turbo. the guy has put a lot of money into it, but the paint job ""by a friend"" worries me.

a decent 928 that only needs a $150 part. of course, you probably should rebuild the whole engine when you put it in.

911s iffy year, looks like the paint is weak.

bad idea mercedes."
1792,"November 14, 2005 9:51AM",stickguy,"wow, that sl is one of the scariest pieces i have seen here in a long time. it ain't a classic, and it ain't an ""easy"" (or cheap) restore. buy a super clean one for a few k more if you really want one of these.

and it is hard to believe that you could cure a smoking/fouling problem for $250, and not do it before trying to sell the car. it could be the difference between a good runner (if the story is true) and a bomber that also needs an engine rebuild (which is what i would assume)

the 911 seems decent, but looks like it is riding low. probably a beater with needs.

run like hell from the 928. needs engine rebuild and ac done? chaching!

i really like the 944 as a car, especially with all the (expensive) recent work done. certianly shows how pricey it is to keep one of these alive. of course, a few things with the story make alarm bells go off, but on this board, i always assume things are as described (unlike in real life)."
1793,"November 14, 2005 10:32AM",Mr_Shiftright,"928s -- i pretty much fell down laughing at that one. yeah, all it needs is one crankshaft bearing? and what does mr. mangled crankshaft have to say about this?

well a mere $12,000 should rebuild that engine, which, on an $8,000 car may not be a good idea.

value? about $2,500 bucks, get used engine if you can find one.

911s --- bad year, worst year for a 911, period. 2.7 engines love to pull studs. best thing for that car? buy it very cheap, buy a used 3.0 engine and be happy.

450sl -- talk about shooting yourself in the foot with how you write an ad. delusion pricing. these cars are cows, dime a dozen, mostly unloved, very expensive to maintain.

i can tell how this car has been treated by the quote from the bodyshop. all that rust work, bodywork and a paint job for $5,500. well yeah, if they bondo it and paint it with a broom maybe. wrecking yard for that baby i'm afraid. hard life, hard death."
1794,"November 14, 2005 10:39AM",fintail,"proper cosmetic restoration alone on that 450sl would equal or exceed the price of a good original car. there's no upside, it's a parts car - a parts car for a car where parts cars are not in demand."
1795,"November 14, 2005 11:42AM",stickguy,"what i thought. do the supposed $250 seal fix to stabalize the oil problem, then just drive it like it is until it craps out. maybe do some light diy type body work (let the kids practice on it) just to keep it in one piece, and use it on up.

with the 911, maybe they can swap a 350 small block into it?? :blush:"
1796,"November 14, 2005 11:55AM",Mr_Shiftright,"a ratty 450sl will grab your pants leg and never let go. you won't have a week's peace with a car like that.

yes, you could put a v8 in that 911 and kill yourself, why not, or save time and money and just drive into a tree backwards with the car you now own. :p"
1797,"November 14, 2005 4:15PM",fintail,"this is cool in a way

and a correct market price is how much less?"
1798,"November 14, 2005 6:14PM",Mr_Shiftright,"if the car is correct, the price is market correct and perhaps a bit cheap if it's really really nice and documented and unmolested.

if it's a clone well $25k should be plenty."
1799,"November 14, 2005 6:55PM",gsemike,"it's sweet but not exactly a ""project car"" unless you consider the second and third jobs i'd have to take to afford it a project."
1800,"November 14, 2005 7:02PM",fintail,"i am leery of that car's legitimacy...i am sure ""coca cola red"" was not an original color.

so real camaro ss 396 are worth 40k if well done? wow"
1801,"November 14, 2005 7:53PM",gsemike,factory big block cars are golden. a big block convertible is outta sight.
1802,"November 14, 2005 8:00PM",Mr_Shiftright,"a legit 396 convertible w 325 hp could bring $45k, and a legit 396 with 375 hp could bring $60k and maybe $70k for a '68 model.

but we are talking stand-up, no questions, no problems, fully documented to the max, impeccably correct automobiles. what you commonly see for sale are not cars that meet this criteria."
1803,"November 14, 2005 8:17PM",xwesx,that's the grey-est car i have ever seen. :sick:
1804,"November 14, 2005 9:28PM",fintail,"would those high camaro prices be for some #1 condition car?

this looks like a decent deal"
1805,"November 15, 2005 7:16AM",lemmer,i like that fiat. i wish he would have provided some engine pictures and information.
1806,"November 15, 2005 8:06AM",lemmer,cheap mr2 - a ton of fun for $1100. why bother changing the timing belt or doing anything else for that matter? a timing belt/water pump service and other miscellaneous could cost as much as the car. great pizza delivery car until it dies.
1807,"November 15, 2005 8:32AM",qbrozen,"i saw this at the dealer yesterday when i was in for service. thought it pretty odd to see something like this at a franchised dealer.
anyway, found it on the web ... price seems really high. what is something like this worth? considering the dealer, i would think its in very nice shape, as the pics seem to indicate.
'79 mark v"
1808,"November 15, 2005 8:45AM",andre1969,"does look like a nice car. i'd be curious to see what the color looks like in person, because it looks like it changes hues depending on how the sun hits it. and the blue on the interior is a bit loud for my tastes.

my sense of price on these things is warped, because i have a friend who obesses over them and owns two of them. he'll find low-mileage examples of fully-loaded diamond jubilee models (supposedly the one to get if you're going to have a mark v) where the seller wants $20k or more.

if i were to take a wild guess, i'd say maybe $3500-4000, if it's not hiding anything scary. my friend's two marks both have the 460, which put out around 210 hp iirc. and one of them was beefed up a bit when the engine was rebuilt, so it might put out more than that. the 400-2bbl was only good for around 166 hp, so i'd imagine that performance for the '79 would be ""dignified"" at best. but then, you don't buy these old boats to drag race!"
1809,"November 15, 2005 9:00AM",stickguy,"that one i would scap up if i saw it by me, assuming it really isnt't rusty, and the engine is sound/strong as described. the rest of the stuff i could either do myself, live with, or have done. would like to know what the problem with the brakes is, since i guess that could get pricey.

but, if the bones are sound, you could probably end up with a decent car that would last a while for about 2k, and have some fun to boot."
1810,"November 15, 2005 9:36AM",Mr_Shiftright,"you are exactly right andre, about $3,500--$4,000 would be all the money in the world and then some for a mark v. asking prices are merely americans exercising their first amendment rights."
1811,"November 15, 2005 9:39AM",qbrozen,"ok, so i wasn't too far off thinking $4500 wouldn't be out of line. i gotta wonder what they gave the previous owner for it."
1812,"November 15, 2005 9:42AM",Mr_Shiftright,"re: camaro---yes, those high prices are for fully restored but perhaps not pebble beach cars. low #1 in other words. true #1s, which are by definition never, ever driven except as required by car shows to drive up a ramp on its own power, have no solid price guide data because most are traded privately. we are talking #1 as a fanatical level of restoration beyond human reason...that is, things like nos factory bolt heads, fully restored glovebox interiors with chromed lock strikers, matching #s on steering boxes and waxed, powder-coated chasssis rails. every single part restored or new, down to the last paper clip."
1813,"November 15, 2005 10:38AM",fintail,"i can't imagine that camaro even being a low #1. i am just surprised at those prices....10 years ago they sure were cheaper! that would have been the time to get in. i still remember going to a local car show in 1995, where someone had a 68 chevelle ss 396 4 speed convertible, very nice original car, everything matching. they wanted like 11k for it.

that edsel i found has me thinking...but that's the last thing i need. i'm a sucker for wide whites i guess. the fintail will get a set when the current tires rot/wear out."
1814,"November 15, 2005 10:50AM",Mr_Shiftright,"the edsel, if clean and straight, is a bit underpriced it seems. but it's a hard car to re-sell to anybody. if you buy it, you'll probably take it to your grave or you'll have to sell at the right price.

camaro: --- well keep in mind that it's only the documented big blocks. any ratty, mis-engined camaro is worth little more than it was years ago."
1815,"November 15, 2005 11:07AM",andre1969,"i kinda like that edsel too, for the price. it certainly looks nice. i imagine those black vinyl seats are not stock, but that's relatively minor...i could live with it.

in searching around on the net, i found out that the edsel 361 was a 100-degree v-8 instead of the usual 90-degree. any advantage to having that?"
1816,"November 15, 2005 11:59AM",fintail,"this is an oddball, not the most exciting car though"
1817,"November 15, 2005 12:08PM",andre1969,"i always liked that style of torino, although it would definitely look better without the vinyl top. looks like it's in nice shape, and the price doesn't seem too evil. wonder if i should email the seller? :shades:"
1818,"November 15, 2005 12:42PM",lemko,that torino is a 1971 model not a 1970. my dad had a '70 and his friend a '71. the '70 torino has a non-divided grille with a round emblem in the center. the '70 fairlane and falcon had a non-divided convex grille with a slim horizontal strip of brightwork.
1819,"November 15, 2005 3:20PM",lemmer,"i am a sucker for a nice frankendatsun. i have no idea what one is worth, though."
1820,"November 15, 2005 3:25PM",british_rover,i have no idea what that is worth either but who would want an automatic datsun or corvette for that matter ugh.
1821,"November 15, 2005 3:55PM",omarman,"the good news:

i turn heads everywhere i go in it, and while it seems like this car needs a lot of work, the mechanical side of the car is solid with very few things left that need done.

the bad news?"
1822,"November 15, 2005 4:08PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i hope that datsun has the brakes and suspension to match the level of horsepower he crammed in there, especially with an automatic transmission.

the bad news on the buick skylark? maybe he would take a harley in trade. :p"
1823,"November 15, 2005 8:18PM",ghulet,"i like the color, looks to be in nice condition in and out, the price is pretty harmless. that said, i know these are universally unloved, even with the turbo, and probably will never be worth much more. what's the hp rating on these, anyway?:

http://chicago.craigslist.org/car/111512230.html"
1824,"November 16, 2005 7:37AM",lemmer,"there is a small cult of followers for these, but i don't know why. they are lucky to keep up with an '83 944 in a straight line, and they have a far more more coarse and peaky power delivery. the turbos don't last long and they stress a generally crappy engine. they don't have the cool fender flares of the 944 and people generally want just as much money for them.

that being said this car seems cheaper than most of what i see on ebay. it is definitely a ""drive it until something breaks"" kind of car."
1825,"November 16, 2005 7:55AM",lemmer,"looks like a ""no"" on that.

""the suspension is factory and is great shape. brakes are new disk / drum."""
1826,"November 16, 2005 9:15AM",lemmer,"does a replica get old enough that someone thinks that it is worth something a classic? maybe that is what happened here.

this old chevelle is so excellent they say it in the title and description. funny though - it doesn't look so excellent.

i've never heard of a cadillac calais, but here is one. groovy interior."
1827,"November 16, 2005 9:16AM",Mr_Shiftright,"datsun/corvette -- death trap, in that case.

porsche 924 turbo --- nah, you don't want that car. the 924s is a much better buy, as you get the entire 944 powertrain in the s. so essentially, you get a 944 for 1/2 the price if you buy a 924s (but not the fender flares)."
1828,"November 16, 2005 9:21AM",Mr_Shiftright,"replicas: those cord replicas are rather popular, and given the price of a real one, $15k for a nice kit car probably isn't too much to ask. certainly it cost way more to build it. they don't look too bad on the outside but of course the interior is simply awful. at least it isn't gutless you can say that for it. probably another death trap but oh well.

chevelle: i'm always amazed to see these stupid people on ebay asking what the ""reserve"" is....

calais: oh, i thought it was the uss nimitz in dry dock...."
1829,"November 16, 2005 9:23AM",fintail,"well, at least the seller is honest"
1830,"November 16, 2005 9:39AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i've seen cars way worse than that restored but of course not rancheros. that baby is gone!

i read about a car restored after sitting at the bottom of a lake for 25 years, but it was a very valuable something or other hidden from the nazis or the russians or you know, one of the usual suspects---it was one of those great stories we used to read in automobile quarterly."
1831,"November 16, 2005 9:44AM",andre1969,"was an entry level caddy...i'd forgotten that they made it as recently as 1975! it really wasn't much cheaper than a deville, and as the focus in the 70's moved towards more and more luxurious cars, the calais fell from favor. i think before it was called calais it was just called ""series 62"" or something like that. that material is a bit too groovy, even for my tastes, but i do like the way they also put it on the door panels. i'm sure it would wear much better than that padded vinyl that tried hard to look like leather, and actually looked nice when new, but would crack and peel very quickly."
1832,"November 16, 2005 9:48AM",andre1969,"i kinda like it. i'd take it for $255! :p i wonder what engine it has in it? i'm guessing the 350...i don't think the 305 came out until '75-76, and i don't think the 307 was still around in '74."
1833,"November 16, 2005 9:55AM",Mr_Shiftright,"it could have a 250, 350, 400 or 454."
1834,"November 16, 2005 9:56AM",lemmer,a bunch of cheap old cars. i will let you peruse on your own.
1835,"November 16, 2005 10:01AM",Mr_Shiftright,"phew---doesn't look like there's a damn thing worth saving in that pile of scrap metal....maybe the 53 chevy panel truck but it looks pretty rough. but all in all, just bombed out sedans and rusted old baseline coupes. maybe that wildcat would be okay, hard to say. i think they are all pretty rusty from the looks of the crop."
1836,"November 16, 2005 10:11AM",lemmer,"shifty, you've ratted yourself out!

""i got a price for an 2006 xa with xm radio, cargo mats, cargo tote, armrest, carpet mats, indigo blue with manual trans for out the door (includes 7.75 sales tax and all license fees) of $15, 255.""

you are the project car hero, and you bought a new car? at least tell us what you did with the old car. when you get the time, maybe you can do a cost per mile on the 928."
1837,"November 16, 2005 10:17AM",andre1969,"would that cord replica most likely have been built on? also, i'm guessing that most of the replicas are rwd? i couldn't imagine a 440 being mated to any kind of fwd transmission, unless it was a setup like the old eldorado/toronado, or those gmc and revcon motorhomes (which used toronado mechanicals, iirc)"
1838,"November 16, 2005 10:26AM",aggie1995,"180,000 miles

mechanically sound

paint needs a lot of work

interior near perfect

what do you think?"
1839,"November 16, 2005 10:48AM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh i still have a couple of other cars. you can't cure a car junkie, no way.

i used to keep 7 or 8 cars when i had the space in colorado. here in sausalito with land about one million dollars a square inch, it's really hard to keep one's project cars close by. i have a few stashed but it's so hard to get to them.

new plan is to buy a small sports car like an mg midget or a spitfire, take the windshield off and sneak it into my office/studio at night. then i'll build a table over it and put it on those wheel rollers.

i need a car no more than 55"" wide (to get through the double doors of the office building) and i'd prefer about 12-13 feet long if possible. the building is a wwii type industrial space.

the 928 is still in use everyday. i have the catalytic off for ""testing"" at the moment. the car speaks v-8 thunder right now. i like to scare my friends in it.

i've ordered a bunch of stuff for the xa for handling and more hp---it'll be my commute/work car but one has to have a little fun. after the powertrain warranty is up, then we'll get a blower for it. i plan to turn it into a modern day version of a 1958 alfa sprint coupe....

you know, you gotta change as the world changes, or as one's world changes at any rate."
1840,"November 16, 2005 10:49AM",Mr_Shiftright,"pleasant car to drive albeit pretty boring, but it can't be worth much so i trust you are bargaining hard on it. at 180k she could roll over and sink at any moment."
1841,"November 16, 2005 10:54AM",fintail,"i am sure someone would jump at restoring a special bugatti, mercedes k, etc even if it had been at the bottom of a lake

i remember the automobile quarterly from when i was pretty young (the locak library subscribed to them and i always got the newest issues i could find) about a big hoard of prewar cars discovered in france, lots of bugattis and other exotics. i remember i was astonished at the time."
1842,"November 16, 2005 10:58AM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh yeah those nutty brothers in mulhouse (alsace)...the schlumpfs, wasn't it?

i've driven a bugatti...what an eccentric car!

it's unbelievable the pain and effort some people have gone through to restore certain cars...it's like their life's work or something. some restorations take ten years.

it must be a great letdown when it's all done, rather anti-climactic."
1843,"November 16, 2005 11:09AM",fintail,"it wasn't the schlumpfs - i have a book on the schlumpfs, most of their cars are restored. this horde was found in the early 80s i believe, and these cars were untouched. to this day i remember some of the pics...there was a bugatti atlantic and a prewar alfa race car, among a couple dozen other bugattis and several other cars. they would only say the location was ""somewhere in france"". the cars were entombed in some old building.

i can't say i agree with the obsessive longterm restoration either. but i would never restore a car to the point of not wanting to drive it."
1844,"November 16, 2005 11:10AM",bumpy,it's basically an rwd maxima. go for it.
1845,"November 16, 2005 11:11AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah that's the schlumpfs. their building was a long kept secret, nobody knew the cars were there. one day the authorities went in there and switched on the lights and almost fainted."
1846,"November 16, 2005 11:23AM",lemko,"...a guy out west named harold lemay? i hear he has a collection of over 2,000 cars? is mr. lemay still alive?"
1847,"November 16, 2005 11:24AM",fintail,"i am sure it wasn't the schlumpfs. their empire fell in the late 70s and their treasure chest was unearthed for all to see. most of their cars were very well kept, as they devoted their industrial assets to their obsession. this thing i am thinking of was like in a dirt floored old barn, these cars hadn't been touched in decades, they were filthy. this would have been in the early-mid 80s. the sad state of the cars added to the fascination.

the schlumpfs were interesting though. in the schlumpf book i have (called ""the sclumpf obsession"", it documents how the brothers went around the world in the early 60s buying every bugatti they could find, and at the time few cars brought more than a few grand. there was a us based collection they bought and had shipped to port on rail, there are pics of bugatti filled rail car haulers.

lemay is actually not far from me. the old man is gone i am pretty sure, but the collection exists. he's an interesting story...a self made local tycoon based on garbage hauling, who also became obsessed with cars. i'd probably be the same way with the right funds.

1848,"November 16, 2005 11:33AM",Mr_Shiftright,"no mr lemay died. most of his cars were just total junkers left out in fields, but he did have some nice cars, too. i used to dream about getting the appraisal job on that collection----geez, i'd still be there doing it!"

1850,"November 16, 2005 12:01PM",lemmer,"the price of a good paint job would exceed the value of the car. it might be ok to drive as is if you could get it for a song.

i had a '93. the engine is almost the same as the contemporary 300zx, and the rwd is nice, but they have a tiny trunk and a small back seat.

perfect ones don't go for much, so not much sense in buying a beater unless it is practically free."
1851,"November 16, 2005 12:01PM",lemko,i remember seeing something about the schlumpfs a while back. their workers were angry that the brothers squandered their industrial empire leaving them out of jobs. they burned an old car outside the schlumpfs' office in protest.
1852,"November 16, 2005 12:20PM",fintail,"i remember that, it was an unrestored austin 7 from about 1930. the british equivalent of a model t/a, luckily not a rare or valuable car. still kind of sad, but i doubt the workers would have been stupid enough to burn a valuable car, as the assets were eventually made public."
1853,"November 16, 2005 12:58PM",michaellno,"a friend of mine bought one of these over the summer ... i think it's a '93 or '94 with 110k on it. picked it up for $4k and put a new timing belt onto it ($1100). it replaced an '84 crx with well over 200k on it...

i agree with lemmer ... very small inside and almost no trunk space. he and i rode with my son up to montecito for dinner and it was pretty cramped - my friend is 6'2"", i'm 5'11"" and my son (16) is 6'1"". he almost didn't fit in the back seat."
1854,"November 16, 2005 3:28PM",ghulet,"...i've never understood why people will fall all over themselves to pay $4k for most 10-12 year-old japanese cars. i never really saw anything special about the j30: kinda small but heavy, not roomy, not especially luxurious, dated styling, lousy gas mileage, rwd but not fun. what's to like?"
1855,"November 16, 2005 4:03PM",michaellno,"can't speak generally, but in my friend's case it was a one owner car (his boss at work), so he knew the history, and, well, anything has to be a step up from a 20 year old crx, especially when you're 6'2"".

besides, the car he drove before the crx was a '76 chevette, which his parents had bought new. he bought the crx in '95 or so, so you can imagine that a 20 year old chevette was on its last legs.

the infiniti, by comparison, is luxurious."

1857,"November 16, 2005 5:21PM",ghulet,"i guess a j30 is a step up from an '84 crx (but not from a '91, imho), but just an illogical progression. they have virtualy nothing in common (maybe that was the goal). i just never liked them; could be because my neighbor got hers stuck in the alley behind my house and kept literally running into my apartment while trying to get out; i don't think i had ever yelled 'get an suv' at someone before or since; it's just plain stupid to have a rwd car w/o traction control in chicago if you expect to get around in winter. it's not even that the snow is so bad, it's more the ice; temperatures change rapidly, so it may snow, then melt, but invariably freeze on the ground by the next morning. and the city doesn't plow or salt alleys, so it's a free-for-all."
1858,"November 17, 2005 7:33AM",michaellno,"i see your point, but since my friend lives in california, the rwd issue doesn't matter much.

otoh, going from the crx at what i would guess is 30mpg on regular gas to the v6 j30, which requires premium fuel and gets <20mpg, his gas bill probably doubled or tripled in size.

he drives all over socal -- he's involved in race horse photography (his web site can be found <a href=""http://www.steelhorse-photography.com/"">here), so he's always at hollywood park, santa anita or del mar in san diego."

i am not a fan of replicas in general, but some of them, like a cobra, are assumed to be replicas by most people.

i've never driven a sebring, but i wouldn't be too ashamed to tell people if i owned one.

the ferraris are total poseur cars and look awful."
1862,"November 17, 2005 3:45PM",rorr,"""are they really atrocious to drive?""

atrocious compared to a modern car or compared to an original? i can't speak to some of the porsche 356 or speedster replicas, but i know that some (i repeat 'some') of the cobra replicas drive better than the originals (stiffer frames and modern suspension/steering/brake systems). just because they'll never hold their value or have the respectibility of the 'orginals' doesn't automatically mean that from a mechanical standpoint, they won't be as good."
1863,"November 17, 2005 4:02PM",Mr_Shiftright,"ford hot rod -- hard to say how it would drive but most glass kit cars feel like you built them in your back yard (which in fact you probaby did). the cobra kits are better because they have been carefully developed over the years in large numbers; also, being loud, rude and open cars people aren't expecting too much in comfort. but a closed car without sound-proofing and built in limited numbers---well, it would feel as you might expect---like a stage coach. ultimate value all assembled? maybe $15,000 if you are lucky. you'll never come out on this one at the asking price. free would be about right. remember this car is a total fake, there is no metal body as with most of the more valuable hot rods.

general rule of hot-rodding: add up receipts, divide by 2.5 = current market value.

i'd like to have that lincoln just to have once owned a car with suicide doors. no, wait, i'd rather have an rx-8 (that gets about the same gas mileage as a lincoln)."
1867,"November 18, 2005 7:23AM",andre1969,"my mom was talking about getting a new car. i was really pushing for a monza at the time, because i thought they were so cool looking. she ended up with a 1980 malibu coupe. probably for the best, because that ended up being my first car. i probably would've hated driving something as cramped as a monza...if it would've even still been running by 1987 when i got my license! :p"
1868,"November 18, 2005 8:45AM",bumpy,sticking a low-power v8 in something the size of a 240sx with a sold rear axle must do wonders for the handling and performance. at least one monza survived into the mid-90s; a friend of mine had one for a little while.
1869,"November 18, 2005 8:48AM",qbrozen,"well, yes, i'd have to say ""compared to a modern car."" is something like that all about looks? is it really worth it to spend, say, $14k on a replica rather than a new hyundai? i guess that's my question.

i always thought i'd like to build a replica one of these days, but is all the fun in the building and not actually the driving?

i think i like the jag replica with the v8. seems like that could be quite the handful. my wife likes the benzes, though. and, for some of those prices, its hard to argue with her."
1870,"November 18, 2005 8:53AM",lemko,...people i knew would always confuse the name - i.e. monza rx7 or mazda spyder 2+2.
1871,"November 18, 2005 9:06AM",lemmer,"i am really not a fan of the benzes or the jags. the big '70s wheels and tires just scream out ""this is a kit car!"" plus they have 4-cylinder engines, so you won't even get the fun of scaring the bejeezus out of yourself like you can in a cobra replica."
1872,"November 18, 2005 9:14AM",andre1969,"when monzas were everywhere and mazdas were a rarity, people probably confused them all the time. the monza with a v-8 was actually somewhat of a porker, around 2800 lb or more i'd guess. they actually used several different v-8's. while most of them were 305's, the 350 did end up in there for a year or two, and there was also another small v-8 of the era, like a 262 or something (not the 267 of '78-82 vintage). they were all the same block though, so i doubt weight differed much among them. also, i don't think any of them put out more than 130-140 hp. i think the 262 only put out around 110!

the main problem they had is that the suspensions would sag and wear out fast under the weight of a v-8, and it would stress out the body structure as well. you could also get a buick 231 v-6 in these cars, which probably gave it a better balance. the 231 was very lightweight for a 6-cyl back then, not really much more than some 4-cylinders. and it was usually good for around 105-110 hp.

if this type of car is really your thing though, i think the mustang ii with a 302 is probably a better bet. scary thought, isn't it? :blush:

when i was a kid my neighbor used to race vegas. he'd get one and put a 350 in it (a ""real"" 350, not smogged 70's 350). i hope he at least beefed up the structure and brakes and such to go along with that power!"
1873,"November 18, 2005 9:18AM",lemmer,"so i am guessing an rx-7, with a 1.1l rotary, could maybe outrun a monza with a v8."

1879,"November 18, 2005 10:01AM",Mr_Shiftright,"the old 356 is a valuable car if correct and sound of body, but those are two enormous ifs.

i've seen so many of these weirdo porsche ads and you'd be amazed what the cars turn out to be---two cars welded together, fiberglass replicas, wrong year, wrong engine, patched up rust buckets with sheet metal floors from home depot, cars with vw engines, cars with 50 lbs of bondo, completely wrong parts numbers (porsche has matching numbers in about 5 separate places on the car, so you can tell if it is one car, two cars or five cars), stolen cars, chopped coupes...it never ends....

value? if totally correct and very sharp, maybe $35,000 is all the money. it's the kind of car for a fanatic collector however, since the pre a cars are not very much fun to drive."
1880,"November 18, 2005 10:09AM",qbrozen,"i think only the elite, really. and, in my opinion, car snobs. i mean, isn't that along the same lines as getting ridiculed in gradeschool because you wore pumas instead of nikes? that's how i see it. i mean, as long as you are comfortable with the substitute and don't try to pass it off as the real thing, what's the problem? hey, this is what i can afford, and its still a pretty and fun car. just like i could only afford pumas and they still got the job done.

i saw a 550 replica once and thought it was beautiful. i stopped the owner and started talking to him about it. i've never seen a real 550 in person, so there is no way i could tell just by looking at it if it was a replica or not."
1881,"November 18, 2005 10:10AM",qbrozen,"actually, that jag is a v8, if the shot of the engine is the same car, that is. and i think the benz (one of them) said something about a ford v6."
1882,"November 18, 2005 10:40AM",lemmer,"i stand corrected about the engines.

i was searching completed auctions for kit cars on ebay. out of any group of cars, i have never seen such a low sales rate. it seems that the owners hold these vehicles in much higher regard than the car buying public."
1883,"November 18, 2005 10:40AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i guess it depends on which replica you buy, but really models like the benz gazelle and vw powered mgtd are so pretentious and so badly done i really have no sympathy for the owners who get razzed about them. it's a bad decision on a lot of levels.

the beck 550 spyders are okay but they are reallly so much less than the originals---however, they are competent enough and fun enough to be credible as kits. ditto some of the porsche 356 speedster replicas. they are cursed with the vw floorpan and thus have none of the spaciousness and interior feel of the originals, and of course have the foul-handling vw chassis to deal with, but they drive okay and look okay.

most of the replicas however are just awful to look at and awful to drive and have botched up all the aesthetics and proportions of the real car.

i think objects of beauty and art deserve some respect. these replicas remind me of tract homes with 3 foot high roman columns made of plaster, or as a friend said ""postage stamp wealth"".

so i'd say one should stay pretty sober about what replicas are and aren't. by all means drive one before you buy one, and sniff out what kind of reception you are going to get. if you think you're going to be invited to car club events by people owning the real cars, think again.

lemmer -- the value of a replica always goes down, and stays down. they are lousy investments as you might imagine.

look, a fake is a fake is a fake and everybody knows it."
1884,"November 18, 2005 10:49AM",fintail,"the gazelles are especially tacky. the fake mgs at least kind of look real from a distance. but my grandma probably wouldn't be fooled by a gazelle. people should just buy a normal old car rather than something like a gazelle.

those fake shay model a's from around 25 years ago looked pretty real too, but with the collapse of the market for such old metal, you can get a real one for not a lot more."
1885,"November 18, 2005 10:51AM",qbrozen,"haha. well, i don't even bother with club events for real cars that i own, so i certainly wouldn't bother with a club that i'd just be a poseur in.

if it drives and looks bad, then what's the point? i guess that's the trick, though. like you said, it needs to be well done.

when you buy an original classic, you are sort of buying the quirkiness, too, which you would obviously be missing in a replica. i don't know if that is an upside or downside.

another question: what happens if you get in an accident with a kit? do they sell replacement panels? or is it a throw-away at that point?"
1886,"November 18, 2005 11:02AM",rorr,"""if you think you're going to be invited to car club events by people owning the real cars, think again.""

actually, i've been to a number of mid-america shelby events which occur every year in june in tulsa (events include car show and track events at hallett) and the kit cobras are always welcomed with open arms. the car shows simply have different areas set up for the real shelby's and the replicas."
1887,"November 18, 2005 11:12AM",fintail,a survivor...maybe a good driver if you like this kind of thing
1888,"November 18, 2005 11:14AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well the cobras are a different animal since the originals were kit cars as well...shelby just built them from off the shelf parts using a pre-made body...you don't get much more kit than that.

besides, trying to have a club based only on original cobras would make for very short and very small car shows. there aren't very many original corbras on the road.

last of all, the cobra kits tend to run and look better than the originals, another odd thing about them.

i'd buy a cobra kit car, but that's about the only kit car i'd buy. (289 based, not the 427 which is an ugly brute imo).



kit car wrecks -- basically from what i have seen is that the kit cars disintegrate when hit hard, so usually there is no car to repair and no owner to complain."
1889,"November 18, 2005 11:18AM",jrosasmc,"what's your opinion on this cheap one i saw today-

'86 mercedes 300sdl, 185k miles, smokes a little bit on start-up, $1400. i spotted this one at some used-car lot in my town. even with the diesels is this a good car to try fixing up and using as a beater?

fintail your opinion would be appreciated as well since you know 126s better than i do."
1890,"November 18, 2005 11:19AM",jrosasmc,message didn't go through...the car is in ok condition but the paint is badly faded.
1891,"November 18, 2005 11:22AM",rorr,"""i'd buy a cobra kit car, but that's about the only kit car i'd buy. (289 based, not the 427 which is an ugly brute imo).""

completely agree. my cousin had one of the era 427sc cobra kits (first, with a 428 motor and later with a 427). he later sold it and got one of the era 289fia kits. with a 289 motor built for the track, that car was quite a bit quicker than the 427 (much better handling car). he said the difference was he was able to consistently drive the 289 car much closer to the edge than the 427.

he's also built a couple of era's gt40 kits for other folks. these things are absolute monsters on the track and look incredibly close to real gt40's. of course, these things will set you back around $70k by the time you get them on the road. i've no idea what kind of value they retain, but i wouldn't be surprised if they depreciate slower than a new base model corvette."
1892,"November 18, 2005 11:27AM",fintail,"what kind of smoke? being a diesel, it might just need a good tuning and some 'diesel purge'. on that engine i think the key issue to watch for is leaks. the mileage is not catastrophic.

what is the body like? and suspension? if it's all there and all ok, it would be a worthy beater, but if something goes wrong, it's an instant parts car. 126s can be a risk, but they are lovely cars if they are right."
1893,"November 18, 2005 11:59AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well i'd pay a shop $100 bucks to lift it and look around. you know how it goes...if it ""only"" needs tires, brakes, ac work, then it's not a $1,400 car anymore, it's a $3,500 car.

i'd give it the ""shiftright test"" for old used cars, which is to take a test drive by yourself, go on a freeway, and drive like hell for 1/2 hour while turning every knob and dial you can get your hands on. if it doesn't overheat, stop, careen off the road, seize, go flat or make horrible noises, and if everything still works, it's a winner."
1894,"November 18, 2005 12:17PM",qbrozen,"heck, i think that's real cheap for a 185k mile diesel benz, if its all there.

of course, asking price isn't taking price, but i've kept my eye out for these cars for a couple of years now and have never seen an asking price even double that amount with those miles. $3500 seems to be typical for less than 200k. don't know what they are really worth, though."
1895,"November 18, 2005 12:28PM",Mr_Shiftright,"it depends entirely on whether anybody took care of it. most old benz sedans i see for sale are all used up. the problem with the diesels is that most of them fell into the hands of people who bought them cheap but couldn't afford the maintenance.

now they are falling into the hands of people who want to burn biodiesel, and i fear they will suffer equal abuse...anyone who is willing to spend hours hauling used cooking oil from chinese restaurants to save money on diesel fuel isn't likely to spring for a $700 major service.

and 185k miles is pretty substantial. personally i think all the claims for ""oh, these will go 300k no problem"" are ludicrous, as if you can drive that far without a substantial investment in maintenance and repair. my diesel was in nice shape and had high miles but it cost $100 a month to keep it tip top.

i could probably tell if that benz was worth the money just by looking at it, walking around it and starting it up for 30 seconds."

if the miles are true (pic of the engine leads me to believe they are) and nothing is busted (is the climate control ok?), then i would think somewhere in the low $2k range (like $2200) would be fair.

but, again, i usually shoot from the hip on older cars. if i like it, i am not against paying for it. tmv and i don't always get along."
1904,"November 18, 2005 12:44PM",fintail,"i sold my 126 in august. i got $5k for it, and i had a buyer lined up before i was ready to sell. it was a 300se, gas of course, and had 182k miles. i was the second owner. it had been very well maintained and looked like a 30k mile car. it needed a few little things...i suspect engine mounts would have made it a little smoother, the brakes and tires were 25-30k miles old and the tires were weather checked a little. but everything worked - cold ac, cruise control, etc. it also had euro lights and was spotless. so there's some kind of market for the nicer cars. i think i could have got 500-1000 more for it, but i wanted it to go to a good home, and for a short time i had 3 cars - i couldn't manage it, no room.

if you live in a harsh climate, also inspect a 126 for rust. they really go around the wheel arches, behind the wheel openings, and around the back windshield."

1912,"November 18, 2005 3:15PM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh god, the road to hell. i wouldn't give you $1,000 for an xjs v-12 but i suppose the real market value is about $5,500. most sensible people (not necessarily any of us here ) avoid these 12s like the plague. they aren't even good looking. you want jaguar with that wood and leather? buy an '86 xj6 and be happy....well, happier.....

i agree...that diesel wagon is just an old wood stove...maybe $3,500 because you can at least get some utility out of it, hauling stuff, etc. but if the tranny takes a dump or some such, you are the loser on that one. the engine alone is worth 2x the entire car."

1915,"November 19, 2005 10:03AM",Mr_Shiftright,i know the early xj40s of that body style had some grievous suspension issues but perhaps the 90s cars are all right if the miles aren't too high and if you have a stack of former owner's maintenance records the size of the manhattan phone book.

1920,"November 20, 2005 10:21AM",andre1969,"that people restore dusters, but more that they hot rod them. a duster or demon/sport with a mild 340 or 360 could easily embarrass many a muscle car with more name value. and while they were never offered with them, they can be made to accept a big block. after all, you could get a big block wedge or hemi in the '67-69 dart/barracuda, which are the same platform.

they're probably plentiful enough in southern/low-rust areas though, that you don't have to settle for a clapped-out beater. i think a lot of older people bought basic versions of the duster and demon/sport back then, too, and held onto them and took care of them. back around 1999, a buddy of mine bought a pristine 1970-71 duster that looked almost showroom-new. it was kind of a drab military-looking green, and i can't remember if the interior was green or black. the only thing it really needed was ball joints, which we figured out (more or less) how to put on ourselves. kind of odd that as nice as it was otherwise, that it needed ball joints. but i heard that these old a-bodies would often go through them in around 50,000 miles if you didn't take care of them."

1922,"November 20, 2005 4:24PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i think you'd have to do so much work to a duster to make it driveable, if you put a big engine in it, that it wouldn't be worth it. if you don't beef up brakes suspension, differential, tires, wheels, etc, all you'll have is a death trap. you can't go from 125 to 275hp without serious considerations for safety, especially on mopars of that body style, which love to crack their frames.

you can buy a duster coupe 340 already built up nd engineered by the factory for $10,000, so why bother pouring money into cloning one?"

1925,"November 20, 2005 6:34PM",andre1969,"just very common and cheap. btw shifty, you're the only one i've ever heard mentioning the sub-frame cracking before on the a-bodies. was it all of them, or just certain years and engine combos? while the design ran from '67-76, perhaps they tried to cheapen something at somme point?

also, i don't know if this means much, but years ago i messed up one of the upper control arms and ball joint on my '68 v-8. i still had my '69 \6 dart around, cannibalizing it for parts. i pulled the control arm and ball joint off of it, and it was a direct swap. so would this mean that the \6 and smallblock v-8 suspensions were identical, with no beefing up?

the v-8 does have bigger brakes, 10"" drums all around instead of 9"". i'm guessing though that there must've been some beefing up somewhere though, because checking the weights, the v-8 darts usually weighed around 180 pounds more than the \6. but the v-8 engine itself was only around 50 pounds heavier...something like 525 lb versus 475. wonder where the extra 130 lb went? would the different intake and exhaust manifolds, bigger brakes, and different transmission case add up to an additional 130 lb?"
1926,"November 20, 2005 8:33PM",Mr_Shiftright,"gee i don't know. i remember the subframe cracking as a fairly serious issue but exact years, i'd have to research. i think 69-72 right around there.

yeah, heavier brakes and heavier shocks for sure, and bigger wheels and tires. so you'd have to swap out the spindles at least and maybe change the rear diff?

i like engine swaps on cars of equal size and strength, but doubling the horsepower on a car that wasn't built for it is risky biz in my book. sometimes you get an evil-handling, evil-braking car out of the deal.

i'd rather see the original v-8 cars saved myself.

you can't save everything, you have to discriminate, otherwise you scatter all your resources to no good end."
1927,"November 21, 2005 7:26AM",qbrozen,"wow. i didn't expect such distaste for the jag.

its funny, but i've always thought i'd rather have the straight 6 myself, just for maintenance/repair purposes, but my father on the other hand, who is a mechanic, by the way, always said ""what's the point in buying a jag if you don't get the 12?""
of course, that was years ago, and he has probably come around to my way of thinking since he's at the age now that he doesn't want to get his hands dirty much anymore.

i do beg to differ on the good looking part, though. i like the looks of these cars.

was the '86 xj with the round headlights or square? i think the square headlights go a long way toward making an attractive car ugly."
1928,"November 21, 2005 7:54AM",andre1969,"that the xj still had round headlights in 1986, although it wasn't long thereafter that they went to those awkward composite things.

i always get the lettering mixed up from that era...but i really love the style of the sedan. the coupe of that timeframe wasn't as timelessly beautiful, but still had an aura about it. it just oozed class (along with coolant, oil, transmission fluid, etc i'm guessing. :shades: )"

1930,"November 21, 2005 10:28AM",Mr_Shiftright,"jaguar v12s are nightmares for owners. it's the typical used luxury car death trap----you get in cheap and then waste all your money trying to keep it running for three days in a row. parts are bone staggeringly expensive, mechanics who even want to work on them are few indeed.

the xjs styling is very awkward and tortured imo, and driver comfort is abominable for a car of this size. your head scrunches up into the roof and you can't see behind you...which is important as you want to keep your eye out for the tow truck. you'll freeze in winter and swelter in summer and suck gas like a leaky pipeline in alaska.

an '86 xj6 will give you everything an xjs will, for a lot less heartache.

i could hardly think of a more useless car than an xjs, because it does nothing better than its 6 cylinder counterparts and everything worse. and its proportions are tortured imo, especially the roofline at the high quarters and the most unappealing snout & headlight unity."

1932,"November 21, 2005 10:34AM",Mr_Shiftright,"912 -- very scary...mention of ""rust"" in a 911/912 bodypan always raises a red flag (no frame---the body is the frame). also, a ""rebuilt"" engine that has been assaulted with a can of spray paint does not raise my confidence level.

914 -- might be okay, he spent lots of money but here again the rust issue can be scary on these cars.

924s -- poor 924s---unloved but very decent cars."
1933,"November 21, 2005 11:01AM",jrosasmc,"i know porsches are in your level of expertise so i'd like to hear your opinion on some observations i made.

i recently read the new issue of excellence magazine and they commented that prices of used 928s are on the rise, especially those made between '88 and '95. they must be right on the mark, because i have yet to see a late-model (91-95) 928 sell for below $20,000.

how about 968s? are they still holding steady in value?"
1934,"November 21, 2005 12:33PM",lemmer,"let me slip in here and comment. excellence numbers are helpful, but i wouldn't rely on them alone.

they seem to apply a halo effect to cars. for example, for a while they had the 944 turbo s underpriced. when they finally boosted it up, they boosted the regular 944s too which they had right before the price increase. same thing for 928s. just because some 90s models are worth $20,000, it doesn't mean a nice '78 is worth $10,000. same thing for 924s. they have the 924s priced similarly to the plain jane 924. i would pay good money for a 924s, but i wouldn't take a plain 924 unless it was free and even then i would have to think about it.

they also have anomolies in their values. for example, they might have two 944s identical in every way but model year, and have the older one worth more. that is true with old corvettes, but not with 20 year old unloved porsche models. they also sometimes will have something like a 1980 911sc go up in value by $500 in a year and right next to it have a 1979 911sc go down by $250 in the same period of time.

i think some of it comes from taking average sales prices reported to them when there aren't enough sales to extrapolate reliable values. plus they don't know the condition of the cars sold except from the owners' reports.

in summary, a lot of their values don't pass the smell test to me."
1935,"November 21, 2005 1:11PM",Mr_Shiftright,"excellence pricing is ridiculously high (in most cases). i think what they are doing is what they say in the pentagon when you believe your own propaganda---""we are drinking our own bathwater"".

perhaps excellence magazine is reading their own ads, from owners who take extremely good care of their cars, maintain them at a fanatical level, and perform numerous necessary and unnecessary upgrades to mechanics and cosmetics.

but these ""gems"" do not represent to me the ""fair market value""....it's the boutique market...maybe somebody could get $10k for a 1980 porsche 928 totally upgraded with bigger brakes, suspension, newer style clutch retrofit, new interior, new paint, upgraded shocks and ac, new style tie rods, etc. sure, why not $10k because you just spent $25,000 on the car and it probably shows.

but that 928 is not an ebay 928 by a longggg shot.

so that's my explanation of the difference between excellence magazine and the real world.

i could deliver flatbeds full of shabby 928s in ""fair"" condition or ""good"" condition for 1/4 the price in their price guides, but ""excellent"" 928s are hard to find and maybe worth the price.

summary: in a luxury or exotic car, the difference in value between ""excellent"" and ""good"" or ""fair"" is enormous---it's not proportional...that is ""good"" is not worth half of ""excellent""...it's worth 1/3rd or less.

so exotics are not like normal used cars in that respect.

excellence needs to get their equations correct vis a vis the relative differences in condition imo."

supercharged 928 --- that car might be a good deal for the current bid of around $3k. '79 is not a good year but the upgraded clutch is a real expensive modification, as is the sc --- somebody poured a boatload of cash into this car.

i like the mustang - no idea on the value.

i think the lesabre coupe, which ran from 1986 until around 1989 was good looking. it was almost too sporty for a lesabre, which might explain why it didn't sell too well. it looked really good in t-type trim. too bad buick had to ""grow up"" in the 90's."
1963,"November 25, 2005 8:29AM",andre1969,"a reasonable price to pay for something like this? for some reason i've always liked this roofline...you could tell that they were trying to conform to stricter rollover standards (which never materialized) yet still trying to keep it a true hardtop. first thing i'd do is ditch those wheels and put some conventional buick mag-style rallys on it. looks like it's not in bad shape though, except for the one rust spot. i'd hardly call it ""professionally restored"", though. :confuse:"
1964,"November 25, 2005 10:17AM",bumpy,"styling was greatly improved by grand national inspired black out trim, aluminum wheels and front and rear spoilers. the interior was improved by installing a console with shift lever, and front bucket seats. a pontiac-style red-orange dash cluster was used to accent the t-type badges and other interior changes. finally, the handling was greatly improved by installing a huge 1.25-inch sway bar in front and a .75-inch bar in the rear.

that sounds nice, but 8.5:1 compression, a 2.97 axle, and 150hp makes the lesabre t-type a ""wheater"" car. put some 20s on it, but don't make the mistake of taking on some kid with 'type r' stickers on his civic."

retract former statements, we're down to $2,000 on that car and maybe less. geesh---how can it be show quality and rusty at the same time? some people....

1977,"November 27, 2005 5:41PM",Mr_Shiftright,"a corvair that doesn't leak oil? now this i'd like to see....really. might be okay for the money if it were really sharp and ran really well. i had this very car once and quite liked it until it got t-boned in san francisco. you'd be wise to fix the rear suspension with a good thick rollbar however or you might end up upside down. also you'll need to do something about the awful gearshift. but these things are certainly workable. kinda cute and original paint, too.

66 chevy-- they are pretty attractive but oh god so big and clumsy. 214 inches long and 3,700 lbs. that's a half foot longer than a mercedes 560sel and just shy of 18 ft.! better if you lived in the new mexico desert where you can park anywhere. good cars though, very reliable."
1978,"November 28, 2005 6:15AM",andre1969,"compared to some of the cars i've had, that '66 impala would probably seem lithe and nimble! 214 inches? i didn't realize they had gotten that big by then. i think my '67 catalina is only around 215"" long, and it's on a 2"" longer wheelbase (121 versus 119)

i think the longest car i ever had was my '69 bonneville. 125"" wheelbase, and 225"" overall. and that was before 5-mph bumpers, so that 225"" was all car! i wonder if the actual bodies of the '71-76 bonneville were smaller, since even with those stick-out bumpers, i think they were only around 224""."

1903 olds -- might be interesting as it says its not one of those nasty lawn mower engines but a replica of the original one-cylinder. badly advertised and described, this guy needs ebay lessons."

(the one that liked to pull the head studs)

and i recall you saying that the 1974-77 911s are the least desirable of them all."
1986,"November 28, 2005 4:24PM",Mr_Shiftright,"the car's junk...i wouldn't even put it on a lift for fear of bending it....really bad news, especially since it's a targa, which makes it structurally weaker to begin with.

i pity the fool who bids on this car. too bad, a 1971 911t is a nice car---it's the ""bottom of the line"" with only 120 hp...a rather lazy engine, meant for ""touring"".

seller obviously took a close look at what he had bought and freaked out. it's time to play ""pass the problem"" on ebay!

75-77: yes, the 2.7 is prone to stud-pulling, premature valve guide wear and severe oil leaking, but all is correctable at the time you rebuild the engine (for a mere $10,000 or so). best thing is to install a 3.0 engine and be done with all the issues on these cars."

subaru xt6 - are you kidding?
subaru svx - what does shifty say about unloved new?
rx-7 93-96 - got something here
infiniti q45 - luxury beater
celica 73-78 - doubt it
supra 78-81 - i can't remember the last time i saw one

1993,"November 29, 2005 8:30AM",andre1969,"those cool little corolla sr-5 coupes weren't included. i liked the little '79-83 hardtops, and the rwd '84-87 or so models were cool, too, and especially the final ones, which i guess were around 1988-1992?

what about the 260/280/300zx? or is it understood that they're already collectible?

i also like the datusn 200sx, the generation which ran from around 1980-1983. and the plymouth saporro/dodge challenger, which were around 1979-83. mazda had a pretty little 626 hardtop from around then, too.

of course, just because i like 'em, doesn't make 'em collectible! :p

fwiw, the 1989-1994 maxima was my favorite, and the sportiest imo. the 1995-1999 was about as exciting as a buick to me. well, okay, a buick that handles and performs well, but stylewise it's the anti-sporty."
1994,"November 29, 2005 8:56AM",lemmer,"there were more cars on the list, but i don't think any corollas were on there.

i think the 240z made it, but i don't think any later z cars did. they referred to the 300zx made during the time period of the 89-94 maxima as the ""bloated fat elvis"" 300zx. if they are talking about the 90-96 version, i disagree. heavy compared to an rx-7 tt, but not compared to much else.

the 240sx also made it.

i agree with you on the maximas, but i doubt any of them will ever be worth significantly more than other used family sedans."

2000,"November 29, 2005 10:14AM",andre1969,"i was under the impressio that all the v-6 models were stick as well. also, the v-6 was a 3.0 liter, not a 3.2 as mentioned in that ad. i think the v-8 they used in the later ""catfish"" models was actually the 2.5 duratech v-6 with 2 cylinders added.

one thing that just hit me...since they could get the 4.6 squeezed under the hood of the lincoln continental, which was based on the taurus, i wonder how hard it would be to get that engine in a taurus/sable? probably not a worthwhile project, but i think it would be interesting!"
2001,"November 29, 2005 10:32AM",lemmer,"from shotimes:

""ford decided that additional low-end torque was necessary to work with the slushbox. the stall speed of the torque converter would have been too high with the 3.0, so ford had yamaha bore the engine to 3.2 liters (the bore went from 3.5"" to 3.62""), bringing the torque peak down in the rpm range while increasing its magnitude. the 3.2 liter engine's torque peak is 215 lb-ft @ 4000 rpm, and the power peak is 220 hp @ 6000 rpm. the corresponding figures for the 3.0 liter engine are 200 lb-ft @ 4800 rpm and 220 hp @ 6200 rpm."""

2011,"November 29, 2005 1:25PM",Mr_Shiftright,"the only car on that list that's ever going to be worth more than $1,500 is the rx-7 twin turbo coupe.

why? for one thing, it's the only one with any serious performance capabilities, and horsepower breeds interest and interest breeds high prices. it's also drop dead beautiful, something the japanese are generally speaking not very good at doing---making a car beautiful.

the rest are, and will always be, either plain old used cars or curiosities.

the svx does have a kind of cult following, but so do studebakers, and those buyers are also cheapskates."
2012,"November 29, 2005 1:27PM",Mr_Shiftright,"the used 911 formula is easy:

if it has rust, don't buy it.

if it's 1975-77, don't buy it

if the engine hasn't had a cylinder leakdown test, don't but it.

that's really all one needs to know to vastly improve the odds.

there was a maxima coupe for that generation. nissan didn't sell a lot of them, but i've seen a few. the 240sx is the king of drifting, mostly for the easy conversion to jdm turbo motors; you almost can't give away the 200sx predecessors (except for the '87-88 v6 versions, but those are rather nose-heavy)."

2027,"November 30, 2005 6:21AM",andre1969,"the last 2-door in the maxima range was around 1980, at the latest, when it was still called 810. back then they offered a 2-door hardtop that had a roll-down rear window ahead of a fixed rear window, a style that was popular among japanese coupes back then. there was also a 4-door and a wagon.

that style's last year was 1980, and the hardtop may or may not have made it that far, as coupes in general started to really fall off in popularity around then. when the 80-84 style came out, it was down to just the sedan and wagon. the '85-88 also had a wagon.

i wonder if a maxima coupe would have really been much of an improvement over the sedan, though? by that time, designers were styling sedans from the ground up as sedans, instead of just coming up with one basic theme and trying to force it into both coupe and sedan configurations where preference was usually given to the coupe and the sedan often looked a bit like an afterthought in comparison. also, in the past coupes were usually sleeker than sedans, with more rakish rooflines and slicked-back windshields, but by the time the 1989 maxima came out, sedans were getting pretty slick, themselves."

hemmings called the article something like ""japanese collector cars you should buy."" they mention in the preface that the toyota 2000gt is the only japanese car worth something. here is the complete list:

89-94 maxima
93-95 rx-7
92-97 subaru svx
70-73 240z
71-73 celica
76-77 celica - what is wrong with the 74-75s?
88-91 subaru xt6
89-92 240sx
79-82 rx-7
79-81 supra
70-73 240z

the ones i forgot:

88-91 prelude 4ws - no chance, prosaic styling, slow, complicated.

70-78 rx-2 and rx3 - the engine in these is almost as expensive and thirsty as in a 93-95tt. they have a small following that seems to be drying up with the supply of 13b rotor housings that are going to later cars.

92 galant vr4 - people would want this plain sedan over an eclipse gsx? not so far.

91-94 sentra se-r - nice autocrosser, but it is getting really hard to find one that isn't used up. how about the datsun 510, its spiritual predecessor?

99 civic si - i like these and they hold their value surprisingly well for a used car.

95-96 mitsubishi 3000gt vr4 spyder - a $70,000 mitsubishi that weighs as much as a big minivan. a total failure.

87-88 isuzu impulse rs turbo limited edition - i owned one of these and have no desire to own one again.

78-80 plymouth fire arrow - what the heck? andre, please explain the greatness of the fire arrow.

86-89 starion/conquest - used car, at least it is rwd.

93-95 acura legend gs - nice car for its time, but i can't imagine people lusting after them in the future.

85-86 corolla gts - andre was right.

88-89 mr2 supercharged - how about the 2nd generation turbo? i like the early cars, but people still use them as beaters.

datsun 2000 - ok, we might have a minor collectible here.

comments? errors? omissions?"
2033,"November 30, 2005 8:28AM",andre1969,"i don't know much about them, but i guess if you really wanted a mustang-ii or monza 2+2 type of car, it was probably as good as any. with the 2.6 they could be pretty quick for the time. road and track tested one and got 0-60 in 9.6 seconds.

and once it got the modern-looking facelift in 1978, the arrow wasn't a bad looking little car. kinda reminded me of the ""face"" of my grandparents' '81 dodge d-50 pickup, though.

as for acuras, one i'd like to nominate is the first-gen legend coupe. i love the style of those! i also like the toyota cressida that ran from around 1985-88."
2034,"November 30, 2005 8:52AM",bumpy,"""89-92 240sx""

that should be 91-94. the '89 and '90 had the sohc ka24 versus the dohc version in the later models, plus they had an uglier nose.

""88-91 prelude 4ws - no chance, prosaic styling, slow, complicated.""

i think the 'lude does have a chance. it's more stylish than the accord coupe it otherwise is. most of the ones i see around are either immaculately maintained or beat to hell and back.

""omissions?""

the obvious ones like the markiv supra, the z32 300zx, and the miata. some less obvious candidates: the second-gen crx, the bugeye integras, the second-gen awd eclipse, and (not a car) the late-80s 4runner."
2035,"November 30, 2005 9:09AM",lemmer,"oops, i left off another one - they had the integra type r. those might have some kind of chance."
2036,"November 30, 2005 9:49AM",Mr_Shiftright,"89-94 maxima --never
93-95 rx-7 yes!
92-97 subaru svx no way
70-73 240z yes!
71-73 celica no
76-77 celica - never
88-91 subaru xt6 never
89-92 240sx no
79-82 rx-7 no
79-81 supra no

88-91 prelude 4ws no

70-78 rx-2 and rx3 - maybe someday sorta kinda

92 galant vr4 - that's a joke right?

91-94 sentra se-r - maybe sorta kinda in a cute puppy discount sort of way. cheap fun always attracts a following.

99 civic si - just a used car

95-96 mitsubishi 3000gt vr4 spyder - a porker, expensive to fix, a clutch eater, unreliable. doubt it but it does have a kind of curiosity value and the top goes down. so i'd say maybe maybe.

87-88 isuzu impulse rs turbo limited edition - junkyard


78-80 plymouth fire arrow - the only greatness is the delusions of the writer of the article.

86-89 starion/conquest - agree, nothing here.

93-95 acura legend gs - just a used car.

85-86 corolla gts - maybe sorta kinda minor collectible for low bucks.

88-89 mr2 supercharged - could have its day in the sun, but far in the future.

datsun 2000 - this ""collectible"" has been waiting to happen for 20 years. they have a small following and are worth some money but i think they are fully priced and have hit their ceiling. so, minor collectible, yes."
2037,"November 30, 2005 10:06AM",lemmer,"i kinda prefer the first generation rx-7 to the 240z. how come it gets no respect? they are reliable, handle well, respond well to light modification, and are relatively good looking. the engines can go at anytime and are expensive to replace, but everything else on it is easy and relatively cheap to fix."
2038,"November 30, 2005 10:13AM",steine13,"mr. s:
since i put it in a footnote to some other car, i'll restate my question regarding the sl500.

a buddy of mine called last night asking whether $12 is a good price for one of these locally (mid-mi).

i told him i had no idea, but that benz's had to be ""just so"" to be worth a lot of money... 100k miles ""great conditon"" and two tops.

in five words or less, what are these worth if nice, and what are the gotchas... you summed it up nicely for 911's yesterday...

at least we have frank's garage, honest mercedes mechanics for 30+ years.

2039,"November 30, 2005 10:24AM",andre1969,"i looked around on a used car lot that was owned by the repair shop that was replacing the tranny in my buddy's '98 tracker. they had two cars there that caught my eye, and priced around the same. one of them was a 1987 regal, last of the rwd coupes, with the v-6. looked immaculate, and was nicely optioned (except for that damn v-6). the other was an '87 acura legend sedan. had a sunroof, cloth interior, and looked really nice except for a rust spot over each rear wheel opening.

there once was a time when in my eye, the regal would've been a no-brainer and i wouldn't have even paid attention to the legend, since even though i liked them, they were pretty expensive. but here they were, both the same price, around $2500, and i actually found myself thinking about that legend! i guess the times they are a'changin.

but now if the regal had a v-8, it would've swayed me back! :p"

depending on the year, you could still get some pretty potent big blocks in those 71-74 chargers though, and even the 318 could move them with some dignity. i'd still take a '68-70, though. or a '78-79 magnum."

re: mercedes 500sl -- good looking car, will no doubt nickel and dime the new owner to death, the $12k price seems suspiciously low to me. i would think a really sharp car (and i am being very picky here) would sell in the high teens to low $20ks....

if the car is the least bit shabby oromblematical, run like hell because everything costs an arm and a leg to fix.

if it's really sharp and trouble free and under 100k, and you really can get it for $12k, there's profit left in that car."

we used to joke that you can get a mercedes in all the bathroom colors. in the late 70s, that was just about true, too. i've got a soft spot for 123's cuz my old man drove a 1980 200 (4cyl carbureted 4sp manual tranny) until '98 or so. he loved that car... it was amazing how solid that thing was until the end. if i could find one in good shape, i'd be sorely tempted to buy it as a summer driver. but not a diesel. i don't drive enough to make it worth the hassle.

2053,"December 1, 2005 10:08AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah i think all 4 chylinder diesels are nasty, because of two things. one, if you have a large displacement 4 cylinder engine gas or diesel(above 2.2 liters) you start to run into vibrational problems, and below 2.2 you have no power. a 5 or 6 cylinder diesel is a much better application of the diesel principle imo.

you may have noticed there are very few 4 cylinder passenger car engines gas or diesel that violate the 2.2 rule.

toyota fj40 --- i'd love one of those but people want way too much money for them, given what you get--stone age machinery. shoot, i could buy an old land rover for that money and look twice as cool and be twice as primitive!

i'd buy a jeep to kick around in if they weren't so unreliable and so expensive to fix.

yeah sure, you see a decent fj40 around, gimme a holler.
i do like to bang around in the sierras occasionally."

2057,"December 1, 2005 12:10PM",qbrozen,"because the straight 6 and differentials are bulletproof. and, even if you disagree with that, they are far from expensive to repair.

i rebuilt my whole tranny for $150 in parts. replacement parts for just about anything on the vehicle are plentiful and cheap. not to mention its so darned easy to work on.

my cj was by far the least expensive to repair vehicle of anything i've ever owned. and i think there are hundreds of thousands of owners out there that will agree with me."
2058,"December 1, 2005 1:10PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i don't have much experience with cjs so i don't know. i know wranglers and cherokees are very problematic. i worked on a few and i have never worked on a more awful car in my life i don't think...maybe a fiat. you just touch something and it crumples in your hand. lotsa cheap stuff on those vehicles. most of my friends have come to grief with them.

it's amazing though the prices you can get for old wranglers. they seem wildly overpriced to me for what you get (and don't get).

a cj v-8 might be fun..... :p"
2059,"December 1, 2005 2:45PM",jrosasmc,when you say cherokees do you mean the small xjs (1984-96) or the first-gen grand cherokees (1993-98)? i know that the earliest gcs had their share of teething troubles because they were a new design.

2071,"December 2, 2005 1:24PM",andre1969,"but i'm guessing it's just that jeep was a brand owned by amc, but not badged as an amc? in the 80's the jeep and amc brand were almost bi-polar opposites. one was cool, while the other was just left-over regurgitations of the amc hornet.

it was ""cool"" to have a jeep. but not to have an amc, i'm guessing. :p"

oh, wait, i just looked it up, it was '87. which is the first year the wrangler was produced, by the way. so still not an amc, technically, although amc had alot to do with the development (which took many years, apparently).

just learned some details i never knew from this site ... although i can't verify its accuracy.

2074,"December 2, 2005 3:00PM",jrosasmc,"having been around jeeps long enough to know their history a bit i can make some comments to you guys-

the 258 i-6 in the cj was also found in other amc products and was carried over to the wrangler when it was introduced in the spring of '86. i recall the 258 as a crude engine that spewed out a lot of emissions and gave wimpy acceleration. it wasn't until the introduction of the 4.0 powertech in '87 that we got the familiar six which we all know and love.

the cherokee had the 360 only from '74-'83, its first generation, when it was based on the wagoneer. the zj grand cherokee had the 318 from 1993-98."
2075,"December 2, 2005 3:05PM",jrosasmc,"how about this one- a friend of mine wants to give me his '95 range rover for free. that's right, free. he got a newer car so he doesn't need the rover anymore, although i'm not so sure i want to be dealing with an older high-miles british product. the beast has 150k miles on it (high for a rover imo) and i know that he's had a lot of work done to the drivetrain.

shifty, you're more familiar with that old rover v-8 in all its iterations...how is it in terms of reliability and longevity?"
2076,"December 2, 2005 3:23PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well it's certainly been around long enough. i don't think all the range rover's problems were about the engine itself, but rather everything attached to it. but that old-fashioned v-8 certainly made that heavy vehicle a dog to drive, especially at altitude.

old range rovers are real scary....but free might work....although, like dangerous drugs, the first free one isn't really ""free"". :p

wrangler---ohhhhh, chrysler took it over in 1987...that explains everything. ever try to work on one of those early computerized carburetors? nasty business, nasty....

my analogy to this is like a guy's animal loving wife coming home and saying she can get a free 15-year old horse. maybe running/walking well when you get it, but as you get attached to it and have to pay monthly boarding and vet bills, it will kill your monthly budget."

the 240z rocks.
the 240sx gets a sr20-det and actually turns into car someone would want as opposed to a sporty looking secretary car with a truck motor. rear wheel drive, not to heavy, and responds well to drifting or racing.
the ae86 (85-86 corolla gts) is a rear-wheel drive drift machene. the are pretty much the shizzle in japan right now. an example in good shape seems to be running about what they cost new 20 something years ago.
the early rx-7s were slow, but reliable and robust, if thirsty. those will have their day.
92 galant vr4- yeah i think i am the only one who loves this car, but its about as fast as a gsx and you can put your kids in the back. hmm, kinda like an m3 4door or a mazda6 mazdaspeed or something.
91-94 sentra se-r the car stole honda's sport compact thunder for a while, also can take an sr20det, ruled the roost until v-tech came out.
99 civic si- yeah, i would say bug eyed integra with b18c before the 99 civic w b16a.
87-89 impulse---he meant 91-92 impuse rs, shared motor with a lotus elan, and suspension as well.
where is the mazda 323gtx, dodge colt turbo/mitsubishi mirage turbo, 90-95 300zx, and early miatas (yeah i know there were a lot of them, but there were a lot of thunderbirds too).
i think the japanese cars are going to be hotter for my generation and below than most of you guys. people like what was in their high school parking lots that they couldn't get or didn't have, or tha they did have and had to sell because of this or that. there is a lot of nostalgia in that."
2081,"December 2, 2005 7:35PM",jrosasmc,"lilengineerboy, if you don't mind me asking how old are you? you seem to have a very good grasp of your japanese car knowledge, unlike most people. yes, i agree with you on the majority of your comments about the above cars, especially with the '93-'95 rx-7...they really had mechanical troubles because of that turbo motor.

as far as off road capability, i don't think that anything beats the hummers. since the h2 is based off of suburban architecture, wouldn't it be pretty reliable?"
2087,"December 4, 2005 5:50PM",Mr_Shiftright,"yes hummers are great off road but they badly designed. given its huge size there is no room in it! how did they do that! it's not easy to make something so big so useless.

2088,"December 4, 2005 8:51PM",gsemike,"i believe that the original hummers have huge center tunnels that really cut into the interior space but allow them to tuck all the drivetrain components up high. that's what gives it such high ground clearance. if you've ever sat behind one in traffic, it looks like you could drive a small car right under it."
2089,"December 5, 2005 7:55AM",british_rover,"we got a h2( so not a real hummer) stuck on our test track. now keep in mind that this track is desigined so even a little freelander can scoot across it as long as you hit the perfect line. we got the hummer stuck in the first 10 feet while try to cross a 24 or so inch deep ditch. the frame in the h2 is so weak that trying to cross the ditch tweaked it so bad that the driveline got into a bind. we could not back up or go forward at all. eventually we were able to rock the h2 out of the bind and back out of the ditch but it took a long time.

oh and if you think land rover and range rover are dead let me quote you the us ytd sales records.

range rovers to end of 3rd quarter------------9,370

total sales all of 2004----------------------23,454

land rovers plan is to launch a new model every year for the next five years. the lr3 was last year the range rover sport is this year and the new freelander(name to be changed) is next year. after that the defender will come back to the us and the year after that there will be an all new model that will probably be called the landy. the concept art i have seen makes it look like a small dune buggy like vehicle."

seriously, though, ""the 4.0 we all know and love""? man, i know plenty of people who would disagree with that!"
2094,"December 5, 2005 10:29AM",andre1969,"that memories of the 258 would differ depending on what vehicle it was in. for the most part it was only good for around 110 hp. in something like a jeep wrangler though, they probably gave it excellent gearing, and if you had a stick shift, that probably made up for a lot of sins.

but then, put a 258 in a 1976 hornet wagon with a chrysler torqueflite and loafy economy car gearing, and you're not going to put too many smiles on people's faces!"

my cousin also had a 4 runner with the same motor, lifted, with a set of 35"" tires. seems like the truck was carbureted, the runner was injected. that 4 runner is tied with my friend's 240d as the most terrifyingly slow vehicle i've ever driven.

the next 4x4 i had, a '92 cherokee, was a rocket by comparison because it had the famed 4.0-liter high-output six. do you remember the 3.0-liter v-6 that toyota made for their trucks from 1988-95? they were also gutless but their weak point was that they liked to blow head gaskets."
2101,"December 5, 2005 4:32PM",xwesx,"eh, it wouldn't get you there in a hurry, but it would get you there. i used to use an '87 4x4 for landscaping. we had put a flat bed on it and 1-ton air shocks coupled to full half-ton leaf springs on the rear. that poor truck.... we once carried a full pallet of landscaping bark (that's 4x4x8 and ~1500#) with a full pallet of fertilizer (broken down and restacked where space permitted). ugh. i shudder to remember it. but, the truck performed admirably, albeit a little slow. then again, i would not have wanted to go any speed but slow with a load like that. heck, that would have made my c20 work pretty good. any 4-cylinder rig that can pull a load like that is worthy of use. surprisingly, its axle bearings were still performing fine after two summers of that sort of use."
2102,"December 5, 2005 7:24PM",ghulet,"not something i'd need for a daily driver (rwd, large enough to be a parking nuisance, thirsty, i don't have six kids), but for a family on a budget, a contractor or whoever would need something like this, looks quite nice for the price (anyone heard from alhubcaps lately?):

2103,"December 5, 2005 8:24PM",fintail,"that old truckster does look good for a few hundred bucks

granddaddy of all ups trucks"
2104,"December 6, 2005 6:52AM",british_rover,i used to work for ups and there are people there that would definetly buy that truck. i should email a couple of them i guess.
2105,"December 6, 2005 6:58AM",lemmer,"i like how he splurged for the eagle gt iis instead of the pep boy tires. the man obviously takes pride in his ride, and wanted to inject a little handling excitement."
2106,"December 6, 2005 7:01AM",lemmer,"i wonder how fast it will go. the current trucks aren't too fast i don't think, but they look fast doing 50 mph down a residential street (with a huge amount of engine and exhaust noise)."
2107,"December 6, 2005 7:06AM",andre1969,"i'd almost be tempted by that custom cruiser. same basic thing as the old '85 lesabre my grandma had given me. i wonder if the station wagon got a different rear end ratio, though. iirc, the station wagon variant added around 500 pounds, if not more, over the sedan and coupes. grandma's lesabre, with its 140 hp/255 ft-lb 307-4bbl and 2.73:1 rear end was, at best, adequate. but then again, you could load that car up to its gvwr and it didn't seem to perform any worse, so maybe that combination could handle the extra weight of the station wagon?"
2108,"December 6, 2005 9:35AM",fintail,"i'm thinking that ups truck is only suitable for under 40mph driving. however, i bet it would be easy to put a big engine in it. i've never seen another old rig like that, different from the usual old milkman vans."
2109,"December 6, 2005 9:51AM",lemmer,"mb diesel coupe. are they really that rare? does that mean they should be highly valued, or that nobody wants one?

2002. it apparently took about 11 seconds for the rust to break through the new paint.

bugatti. on the cheap.

firebird. original looking. don't you love it when people outsmart themselves and end up bidding more than the original buy-it-now price?"
2110,"December 6, 2005 10:28AM",stickguy,"bad year for a 2002 imo, and that one looks ratty.

now, if i had found the firebird buy me for $4,900, i would have bought that. looks nice, and reminds me of my 1st car ('67 camaro), other than it isn't a 6 cyl pg with massive rust.

should be a fairly easy clean up resto to driver status, just don't go overboard, although i imagine it would be fairly easy to clone a t/a (they have them in '67?) or some other higher end package.

so, the bird looks like a fun project that isn't likely to kill you too bad (if it is as sound as claimed). nothing like starting your new hobby and immediately finding out that the frame rails are rotted out to ruin the party."
2111,"December 6, 2005 10:47AM",fintail,"that w123 coupe is more desireable in that it's a later turbo car, but it's not really ""rare"" per se. and i think just about all of them survived. looks like a decent enough car though. i do spot a w116 nosing its way into a few of the pics, i wonder if the guy is a mb enthusiast.

i remember when i was little a local ford lot had one of those fake bugattis in its used section...i wanted it."
2112,"December 6, 2005 12:28PM",Mr_Shiftright,"no, the turbo coupe isn't rare. in fact, it's probably worth a bit less than a sedan, as it is less useful....or if not worth less, harder to sell at any rate. people driving old benz diesels aren't into ""sport"" after all.

""bugatti"" -- awful, it should be crushed, it's blasphemous and in horribly bad taste. a paint by numbers mona lisa?

2002 -- yet another beater 2002. just go buy a nice one and be happy and leave these dogs alone. you'll never come out alive on a car like this. if it was an earlier round taillight car and with a nicer interior, i'd say go for it at that price. but a rusty '76, no way. it can barely get out of its own way."
2113,"December 6, 2005 1:35PM",jrosasmc,i currently drive for ups and i think those trucks are fun to drive in their own twisted way (albeit with no power).
2114,"December 6, 2005 4:06PM",lilengineerboy,"wow, i was away for a few days and it got burried. i am early 30-something. yeah, i an definitely more up on cars than 4x4s, but the fj-40 and the 4 doors through the 80s (before they turned into japanese escalades) would be on my list for japanese 4x4s. a big issue is it took japan a little while to learn how to make steel and how to design things to resist corrosion. even 4-runners have a lot of rot over the rear wheel arch if not kept after, and apparently the patch panel runs $700 from toyota (of course, they do actually have them unlike some german makes i won't go into).
the mitsu/dodge raider is kinda neat too, but i don't know if it will ever be worth anything.
i have a friend with a 1st gen pathfinder, its got some rediculous number of miles on it and he loves it, had it since hs. dunno if that will be worth something or not, but its been durable."
2115,"December 6, 2005 4:11PM",jrosasmc,yeah i used to have an '86 toyota 4x4 truck...i could not control the rust around the bed area.
2116,"December 6, 2005 4:11PM",lilengineerboy,"yeah, when you add big wheels, you change the final drive ratio, not to mention they way a million pounds each. good for bling, bad for actually going anywhere. also, that mass is hard to change direction, in addition to accelerating or decelerating.
the 22r equipped toyota 2wd 1ton had just over 300k on it when my friend's sister wrecked it. it got 2 people and 5 mountain bikes over the pass with no problem, it shelped wood, soil, scrap, whatever, and never had an issue.
it wasn't the fastest thing i'd driven, but was fine with that 4spd and 14 or 15"" tires (cant remember which)."
2117,"December 6, 2005 5:58PM",fintail,this is kinda sad
2118,"December 6, 2005 6:09PM",Mr_Shiftright,"to the wrecker with that one....

insurance company totalled it for a reason after all. think of all the '96 olds owners it will make happy."
2119,"December 6, 2005 6:15PM",bumpy,not even a parts car. that thing is going straight to the crusher.
2120,"December 6, 2005 6:26PM",lilengineerboy,sometimes you have to know when to fight with the insurance company.
2121,"December 6, 2005 7:09PM",fintail,just seemed sad to see such a low mileage (and getting older) vehicle ruined over what to many would look like a minor accident.
2122,"December 6, 2005 7:22PM",Mr_Shiftright,"you may not realize how utterly worthless a '96 oldsmobile actually is, in terms of market value. you could have totalled that car with a can opener, literally. i doubt it's worth more than $2,000 clean and undamaged.

so why put any money into it? it makes no sense. just go buy a 1996 olds already together if you want a cheap car. and it won't have a salvage title.

we are rapidly entering the age of the disposable automobile. better get used to it. cars will be hit and junked more and more often now."
2123,"December 6, 2005 7:39PM",jrosasmc,what about those traditional body-on-frame light trucks and suvs? do you suppose they'll also fall victim to the junkyard if they are hit?
2124,"December 6, 2005 9:00PM",Mr_Shiftright,"it all depends on market value, not construction i think."
2125,"December 6, 2005 10:06PM",jlawrence01,"we are rapidly entering the age of the disposable automobile. better get used to it. cars will be hit and junked more and more often now.

especially when all these cars have 4-6 airbags that have to be replaced after any frontal accident.

i could get $3500 for that oldsmobile with 14k if it was in good condition (i.e., before the accident)."
2126,"December 7, 2005 6:41AM",andre1969,"the insurance company gave me something like $2200 for a totaled 1986 monte carlo with 192,000 miles on it! but this was back in 1998...while the car was 12 years old at the time, domestics tended to hold their value a bit better back then.

fwiw, kbb on a good one with 15k miles is around $4500. of course, what it would actually fetch is another story, and any salesperson posting on edmunds will often tell you that kbb is way off (yet why do so many dealership websites bring it up then, or put it on the window sticker? :p )

anyway, the biggest problem with that olds is that nobody would want it. they didn't make very many of them by then. it would make an excellent parts car, or if you could find a good parts car for it, it would be a good fixer upper. the problem, though, is that nobody cares if these things get smashed, and when people wreck them they usually just junk them, so there's little demand for parts cars.

a lot of the mechanical stuff like the engine, tranny, rear suspension, steering column, etc, would probably be salvageable, and could be useful on any 1992-1999 gm h-body (bonneville, lesabre, 88). windshield too, and most likely the front window glass, although the rear windows and rear window would most likely be different. unfortunately, most of the sheetmetal wouldn't swap, because gm was trying to make these cars more unique by this time.

at least there's one advantage to badge-engineering cars. if you smash the door on your '98 crown vic, the door on a wide range of crown vics and grand marquises should fit. actually, from 1998 onward, i think the crown vic and grand marquis shared all the same sheetmetal. it was just easy-swap stuff like taillights, grille inserts, and possibly the front header panel that they changed.

way back around 1977 or so my granddad bought a '53 desoto firedome from his brother-in-law, for something like $200. it had belonged to his mother, who had a stroke while driving and hit a parked car. it was then put into storage, and years later when she passed away, my great-uncle sold it to granddad when it came time to settle the estate. appearance-wise, it was in much worse shape than that olds. i remember the fender on the driver's side was smashed way back, and the hood was pushed back at a seemingly obscene angle. front bumper was also smashed and most of the grille ""teeth"" were either smashed or missing. it was also just enough of a hit that it buckled the passenger side fender just a tad. i remember granddad went and got all the parts he needed (minus the passenger-side fender...i think he planned to just pound it out) from a junkyard for around $80-100, and fixed the car himself.

now granted, nearly 30 years later it would cost a lot more to fix that desoto. parts would be much more scarce and more expensive (although the '53 he pulled the parts off of is still sitting in the junkyard!). still, it's sad to think that something smashed as minor as that olds is a total. considering the airbag took out the dash, i'd guess that the airbags alone would run around $1500?

as for salvage titles, that '96 olds might not have one. i've had two totaled cars (the monte and a '69 dart) that i just held onto and paid a deductible from what the insurance company would have given to me. they didn't do anything with the title."
2127,"December 7, 2005 6:44AM",andre1969,"i just noticed the windshield on that olds is smashed, too. what would that add nowadays? another $400-500 or more? last time i broke a windshield it was in my dart, and it only ran around $150 to replace. now that i think about it though, the windshield on my '88 lebaron coupe got broken, and it was around $500 to replace. insurance picked that one up, thankfully."
2128,"December 7, 2005 8:11AM",lemmer,"a dude i work with drives a '96 century (poor fellow), and a recent replacement of the rear window with rear defroster was only $195. i don't know if rear windows are generally more or less."
2129,"December 7, 2005 8:17AM",andre1969,"i don't know, either. one thing i remember about the lebaron, is that to replace the windshield they also had to replace the blackout (i think it was just painted aluminum) trim around the windshield. that might have made it more expensive.

i wonder if those old gm windshields that had the antenna in the windshield were much more expensive to replace than the regular ones? luckilly i never broke one out! my mom's malibu had one, and the windshield got broken, but she had it replaced before she gave it to me. my lemans and silverado have those antennas, and the silverado's windshield has a few stone chips here and there, but thankfully nothing that's spreading."
2130,"December 7, 2005 9:23AM",fintail,big
2131,"December 7, 2005 9:32AM",Mr_Shiftright,cars of that size are looking increasingly ridiculous in today's world aren't they? everything is so much more crowded---imagine trying to squeeze that into most modern mall parking lots?
2132,"December 7, 2005 9:46AM",british_rover,???????

2134,"December 7, 2005 9:52AM",Mr_Shiftright,"especially with rust on it!!

interesting car, worth maybe half of asking price at best."
2135,"December 7, 2005 10:01AM",andre1969,"how big is a '73 era new yorker, anyway? for some reason i'm thinking they were just over 230"", but they never seemed that big to me.

fwiw though, just about any full-sized pickup made in the past 30 years or so is just as wide and these days most of 'em are longer, so a car like that should be no worse to maneuver than the #1 and #2 selling vehicles in this country right now."
2136,"December 7, 2005 10:04AM",lemko,holy smoke! my neighbor back in the old 'hood had a big chrysler like that. it was always parked in front of my dad's car. dad had a 1972 ford ltd at that time.
2137,"December 7, 2005 10:14AM",andre1969,"isn't around 233"" about as long as mass-produced cars got? i'm thinking that the big 70's continental sedans and town coo-pays were around 233"". i just checked, and the big pre-downsized fleetwoods of the 70's were 234"", while the devilles were ""only"" 231"". i think the mark v is like 230.4"". the '71-78 eldorados are actually tiny little things, only around 225"" :p funny how they seem so big, though. maybe it's because of the ultra-long hood?"
2138,"December 7, 2005 10:20AM",bumpy,one thing i don't like about those early-70s barges is how little interior room there is compared to the overall size of the car. i bet a hyundai sonata is roomier than that thing.
2139,"December 7, 2005 10:33AM",lemmer,"anything with adjustable boost, i value at market value less the cost of a new engine."
2140,"December 7, 2005 10:56AM",ghulet,"so, this is probably the nicest of its kind on earth. and technically it is 'rare'. i personally think it's cool, but who else would want it? it's a 4-door sedan (why are these always owned by old men, saved and fussed over and polished while the coupes and convertibles end up in junk yards?). mercurys of this era, more than being 'unloved', are just ignored:

http://cgi.ebay.ca/1968-68-mercury-park-lane-parklane-mint-rare_w0qqcmdzviewitemqqcategory- - z6882qqitemz4594672924qqrdz1

nice as it is, the buy it now is probably twice what it's worth."
2141,"December 7, 2005 11:00AM",andre1969,"some of those old 70's barges were lacking in some respects in interior room. however, they also didn't have to deal with huge driveshaft/tranny humps, wheel well intrusions, etc. and because they were low-slung, the seating position was more stretched out, as opposed to upright like today's cars. the epa wasn't rating cars for interior volume yet, but something like that '73 nyer would probably have around 108 cubic feet of interior volume and around 22 cubic feet of trunk space. basically, close to what a crown vic would have today.

however, if you needed 6 passenger seating, no sedan built today would fit the bill as well as that nyer. the main reason that cars today have seemingly generous interior volumes is because they're taller. a taller car isn't going to let you fit more people in it though. and because today's cars have curved roofs, where you position the front seat can have a big effect on headroom. for instance, headroom's fine for me in my '00 intrepid, but my great-aunt, who's short but has a beehive hairdo, hated hers because where she had the seat adjusted, she'd hit the ceiling! back in the old days, the roof was usually flat enough over the driver's seat that it didn't matter where you put the seat...headroom wouldn't change.

another area where cars got much more efficient was rear seat legroom on 2-door models. but since most 2-doors are gone now, that's a moot point!

one reason that nyer might look small inside is because of the relatively high beltline and low roof, which gives it somewhat of a tank-like appearance with a claustrophobic interior. also keep in mind those seats were much bigger and thicker than most cars of today, so that might make the car look more cramped inside."
2142,"December 7, 2005 11:27AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well that's kind of a left-handed compliment isn't it, to say that a '73 chrysler weighs about the same as, and is long as as full size long bed pickup truck?

but i agree, either vehicle is ridiculous for one person commuting with no luggage."
2143,"December 7, 2005 11:33AM",fintail,"when i look at the traffic and parking in my area, it does make such big old barges look silly. the same way the posers and trophy wives in their escalades and h2s and lexus suvs of all types look so bad.

if you live in a smaller town though, what the hell.

that 68 mercury does have to be one of the best left. but that buy it now is well over twice the actual value i am sure.

about 4 years ago i ran into a guy with an immaculate 66 mercury, parklane i believe, whatever the top of the line model was with the breezeway window. it was creme yellow with a black vinyl top, and it was excellent looking. he wanted $2500 for it."
2144,"December 7, 2005 11:39AM",andre1969,"not a left-handed compliment aimed at the chrysler, so much as pointing out that the more things supposedly change, the more they stay the same! heck, these days most mid-sized pickups probably weigh more than that nyer! :p"
2145,"December 7, 2005 11:43AM",lemko,"holy smoke! it's steve mcgarrett's old ride! book 'em, dano!"
2146,"December 7, 2005 11:47AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah but the pickup truck can do a lot more work. nobody today would buy a passsenger car that size or that uneconomical, or very few people, even if they were cheap.

but sure, everything seems to be getting bigger and heavier and more powerful, even porsches."
2147,"December 7, 2005 8:03PM",ghulet,"yes, similar to mcgarrett's, except his was a four-door hardtop, which i think did not have the breezeway window.
oh yeah, if you read this guy's ebay ad, it claims production of something like 708, which, according to a book i have was 7008. oops. there goes the 'rare' part, at least from a production standpoint."
2148,"December 8, 2005 6:19AM",jrosasmc,"have you picked up a copy of collectible automobile magazine yet? they have a great article on the 1982-89 plymouth gran fury, as well as a summary of other m-bodies.

by the way what did happen to your '89 fury?"
2149,"December 8, 2005 6:38AM",andre1969,"yeah, i noticed that. it turns out that now i've had two models that were featured in the ""cheap wheels"" section of collectible automobile! a couple months back they did a spread on the '79-81 new yorker.

as for my gran fury, it went through a bad phase back in 2002 where it was eating starters regularly. fortunately i had a warranty, but it got irritating having to get the thing towed back to the shop (occasionally i'd get one last start out of it, and was able to drive it myself). finally they got a starter on it that worked, but then a few months later the water pump went out. it had around 118,000 miles on it by that time. i let it sit for awhile, and then got something ominous in the mail. an emissions test notice. somehow, that car had slipped under their radar and for four years i never got called in. i had thought that because it was an ex-cop car, it was exempt.

well, i figured there was no way in hell it would pass, and i was amassing enough of a fleet by that time that i just parked it at my grandmother's place and cancelled the insurance and turned in the tags.

then i discovered that a lot of the parts on it would swap with my '79 nyer. the copcar wheels went on the nyer. so did two power window motors, and i put the full-sized copcar spare in it. i think i pulled the hood ornament off of it too, to keep as a memento. i tried to start it every once in awhile, but eventually the battery died on it and i let it sit for awhile.

in late 2003 i moved in across the street from my grandmother, and in the spring i tried to start that fury so i could drive it over, but no luck. it would turn over, but just wouldn't catch, even with dumping a bit of gas down the carb. so i hitched it to my truck with a chain and towed it over, so at least grandma didn't have to look at it anymore. finally ended up selling it for parts. i dunno what ultimately happened to it. the body was still good, with no rust at all, and the interior was near perfect. the paint was pretty shot, too (typical bad late 80's paint that was repainted in 1998, but by 2004 looked bad again)

sometimes i kinda miss that car. it was a great handling car, and had plenty of legroom for me, although the steering wheel was kind of close. and it was a heavy, sturdy sucker too. also had decent performance. it was a horrible guzzler, though. the epa rated it at 13/15! in contrast, the civilian model was 16/22, and the police pursuit (basically a copcar with a civilian engine) was 14/18. the 4-bbl and 2.94 rear end (civilian was a 2-bbl and 2.26 rear) really took their toll.

i could actually break 20 mpg on the highway, but around town it was more like 11-13. and it had an appetite for premium fuel.

here's an old picture of it, taken at the mopar nationals back in 1999. don't ask me what i was thinking when i did that to my hair, though! :blush: that old pic shows how much the mopar nationals has grown over the years. back in 1999, they stuck the 1975-1989 rwd stock cars up on the hill, kind of in no-man's land, and they used most of the field in the background for paid parking. nowadays though, that whole area is part of the show field, as the number of cars showing up has really shot up."
2150,"December 8, 2005 7:33AM",british_rover,a few years ago i did a comparison between this car bonnevil and a gas engine ford excursion. they have about the same dimensions for length and width the ford is obviously taller and a little heavier. if i can track down the essay i will post it.
2151,"December 8, 2005 8:05AM",andre1969,"how would they get a 200r4 tranny to handle that much power?! :surprise: for the most part, the strongest engines that tranny ever had to deal with was the olds 307 and chevy 305. there was a heavy-duty version, though, which was used with the grand national, and possibly the monte ss and cutlass hurst/4-4-2.

wild looking car, though! i wonder what kind of fuel economy it gets...would the overdrive really help on something that brutal?"

2153,"December 8, 2005 8:43AM",andre1969,"i'd guess the lt-1 would also be plenty of engine to move a car like that, when you consider the '57 caddy only had like a 365 cid or so.

i had to laugh at the rain-x comment, too. i can identify with that one...had to do it on my '79 nyer now for awhile, when the windshield wipers weren't working. but then, strangely enough, i finally took it to the mechanic, who never could get them to fully work right, but about a week after i got it back there was a loud clunk, and now they seem fine again! :confuse: now if only the air conditioner and radio would fix itself, and the carb would sprout another 2 barrels... :p"
2154,"December 8, 2005 9:11AM",lemko,"a guy in my car club built what he believed a 1996 cadillac fts (fleetwood touring sedan) would look like. he used the lt-1 engine out of a corvette (not that the stock fleetwood engine was a slouch). made a custom body-colored grille with fewer and coarser cross-hatch bars and a wreath and crest in the center in lieu of the regular fleetwood's stand-up ornament, used 1996 impala ss wheels with the regular fleetwood's centers, and custom badges with lettering similar to that on the sts and etc. other mods included a floorshift console and quad exhaust outlets. the car was finished in crimson pearl. the result was well done actually quite tasteful - sort of a cadillac version of the 1996 impala ss."

i agree, ""matching numbers"" on an amx might be preferably but not much of a market factor. there's not an amx in the world you can't buy for $20,000 and most you can buy for a lot less, even in super sharp condition.

2172,"December 12, 2005 9:56AM",andre1969,"to see a performance increase out of that '70 caddy would be to change the rear end. i have a friend with two '78 mark v's. both of them are 460-4bbls, which put out something like 220 hp by then. one of them was rebuilt and hopped up a bit, and has a dual exhaust, while the other is totally stock. i can definitely tell the differnce between the two, but they both still have the piggish 2.50:1 rear end, which is going to hold back a lot of that extra power.

the '70 coupe deville probably has a 2.94:1 axle, which is a good balance of power and economy, so you might actually see something out of those performance upgrades. i think a 3:08 and 3.21 axle were also available."

i would be concerned with the starter, and how good is it for a 944 to get push started anyway? if it really is $200 and 5 minutes, do it, since not being able to start the car is a major drawback to selling it.

let me ammend my comment. for $2,200 if it starts right up and runs as well as presented, go for it.

i always assume that comments about ""cheap/easy"" fix of something that is a major issue (like it keeps the car from running) are bs, since if it really was that cheap/easy, the owner should just do it before selling."
2174,"December 12, 2005 10:06AM",andre1969,"at least it still had a powerful engine, the 340. the 340 actually lost very little power in the 70's, as i don't think it was decompressed as badly as many of the other engines, but the car was still plagued with the added weight. i think by '73 they had around 240-245 hp. the 340 was also an engine that liked to rev and gave good all-round performance, whereas the 360 that replaced it wasn't as good, even if the peak hp remained the same.

by 1973 standards, a charger 340 is probably as much of a musclecar as anything else that was out there by the time. the pontiac gto had a standard 230 hp 400 and an opional 250 hp 455. there was supposed to be a ""super duty"" 455 with 310 hp, but it never made it into any gto's. supposedly if it saw the light of day, it would've rivaled any gto that ever came before it. and that's quite possible, because 310 hp net would be easily over 400 gross."

re: muscle cars---there comes a point when the name gets abused, and a '73 charger abuses it imo. if that's a muscle car, what do you call the ones before it?...super muscle, extra muscle, real muscle? you see the problem. it is ""inflationary nomenclature"" and just confuses everyone.

porsche 944: you never ever ever buy a non running porsche for anything more what you could easily part it out for."
2184,"December 12, 2005 1:15PM",andre1969,"is not a musclecar. never was. it was certain configurations of the charger, like the r/t, that made it into a musclecar.

i don't think calling something a musclecar devalues other musclecars. after all, not everything can be best-in-class, and there have certainly been some mediocre musclecars over the years. a 1957 chevy is just a standard-sized low-line car, but calling a '57 ford, plymouth, or studebaker a standard-sized low-line car does nothing to devalue the chevy. just as calling a '73 charger 340 a musclecar does nothing to devalue a '64 gto, hemi road runner, etc. those cars stand on their own merits.

so, while it may not be a very good musclecar, i'd still call a '73 charger 340 a musclecar. now with the 440 6-pack, it would've been a better one!"
2185,"December 12, 2005 1:27PM",fljoslin,i would call a 73 charger with a rebuilt to 1969 specs 340 a muscle car. odds are the engine needs a re-build anyway and at least it would have disc brakes.
2186,"December 12, 2005 1:56PM",Mr_Shiftright,"if you broaden the definition of everything, it renders the word meaningless...that's the problem. if everyone is beautiful, in fact no one is beautiful.

so i'd never call a '73 charger a muscle car because then car guys i have to deal with wouldn't know what i was talking about.

if you tap me on the shoulder and say ""look, muscle car! i'm looking for a compact car with a huge engine in it, not a revamped taxi cab.

the collector car hobby is already a tower of babble. i'd hate to contribute more confusion to it."
2187,"December 12, 2005 2:03PM",stickguy,"i think you just eliminated a bunch of the market with that definition!

2189,"December 12, 2005 2:13PM",stickguy,"at least a machine with a 401 ""ho"", 4 speed hurst, etc. fits the spiritual idea of a muscle: smaller platform (mid-size?), biggest engine they had to jam in there, pretty basic with the extra stuff added for performance (forgetting the decal package at least..).

sounds pretty similar to a '64 gto to me."

2191,"December 12, 2005 2:45PM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh if you mean the ""rebel machine"" that would be okay, sure. i meant just the plain old rebel 304, which is only 36 cubic inches away from a plain 'ol '73 charger."
2192,"December 12, 2005 2:45PM",andre1969,"is that a '73 charger is kinda like a '64 tempest. not a musclecar. but a '73 charger 340 (i forget what the package was called) or a '73 charger r/t with the 440-6pack is a musclecar.

similarly, a coronet is not a musclecar. a coronet r/t or coronet superbee is. basically what i'm getting at is that '73 charger is not your run-of-the-mill taxi special. if that were the case it would be sporting a 100 hp slant six, 140-150 318, or a 400-2bbl with maybe 175 hp. but here you have a smallblock with 245 hp that's outgunning many big-blocks.

the rebel was amc's midsize line, which ended up becoming the matador. the rebel, in and of itself, isn't a musclecar. however, there were musclecar versions of it.

2194,"December 12, 2005 2:53PM",andre1969,"to see if i could find an example of a plain, basic 70's charger. looks like they're mainly high-performance versions with the 340, 400-4bbl, or 440. i can't find any low-suds versions with just 318's, slant sixes, or 400-2bbls. maybe i'm wrong...perhaps the charger didn't have a slant six in the 70's?

i know that after 1970, dodge dropped the 2-door coronet and just called all their 2-doors ""charger"", which cheapened the name. maybe they still kept the weaker engines out of them?"

contrast that with ""real muscle"", a 1970 440 is 1:8.9 and a 426 is 1:8.2

to me, any credible ""muscle car"" has to have an impressive power to weight ratio."
2198,"December 13, 2005 6:12AM",jrosasmc,"when i was reading the latest issue of ""bimmer"" magazine they noted in an article about the 8 series that its v-12 engine (first seen in the 750il) was one of the last ""overbuilt"" engines in the automotive industry. i know that v-12 does have its virtues and vices though- i also came up with a brief list of some engines that i consider to be ""overbuilt"" and maybe you would agree with me or attest to them on these:

toyota 22r: simple and sturdy motor.

jeep 4.0 straight-6: very reliable and powerful but gas-hungry.

mercedes v-8s ('70s thru '90s): way over-engineered.

volvo b21: the company's first ohc engine that debuted in '76- ran forever.

porsche 911 flat-6: i wanted to save the best for last...those beasts run and run and run."
2199,"December 13, 2005 6:35AM",andre1969,"you have to convert from gross to net hp, or any comparison is meaningless. and many of those gross hp numbers were fudged considerably, so an inexact science. a good rule-of-thumb is to take 75% of the gross figure, and that's net. however, there are many exceptions. for example, the 340 was under-rated back in the 60's, partly for insurance purposes but also partly because it was capable of embarrasing many big-blocks. and what's the sense of having some of those big-blocks if the smallblock was putting out close to the same hp? so the 340-4bbl was under-rated at 275 hp. when it was rated in net hp, it still came in at 245 hp, or 89% of gross. the 426 hemi was also under-rated a bit, at 425 hp gross. net, it came out to 350 hp. of course, this was the ""street"" version of the 426...racing versions were much more powerful.

in 1973-74, chrysler was still building 440-6packs, which put out 330 hp net. that would've been good for an easy 440 hp or so back in the 60's, in gross terms. pontiac was also building a handful of 455's that had 300 hp net, which would be good for around 400 hp in gross terms.

now when car companies started putting out these boat anchor 400's that only had around 150-175 hp, and 440's, 454's, 455's, and 460's that were so choked down they hardly broke the 200 hp barrier, it was pretty much over. but there were still a few bright spots in the 70's, although they became much fewer and far between as the decade wore on.

an early 70's 318-2bbl actually isn't a bad performer for its class. back then you usually had to go to a 350 with a gm car or a 351 with a ford to get similar performance. i'd guess 0-60 in an early 70's charger with the 318 would be around 12 seconds. supposedly performance on the mopars really started to suffer when they went to lean burn, which i think was 1975 for the smaller engines. i don't think the advertised hp went down much, but real world performance did...even when the thing was functioning properly! they also started putting taller gears in the cars later on, which hurt performance. in the early 70's, i think it was common for 318 cars to have 2.76:1 or 2.94:1 gears, but later on 2.45:1 became the norm.

i'd consider the grand national, as well as the monte ss and the olds hurst/4-4-2 from the 80's to be musclecars, as they had considerable performance upgrades from their more mainstream counterparts. and the grand national would easily embarras most 60's musclecars. i guess that's not saying much anymore though, because these days a v-6 accord or altima with an automatic tranny would, as well. :blush:

it would be interesting though, to see how some of those old musclecars would do with the better tires of today. i'm sure that makes a lot of difference. and a tranny with a few more gears like what they have today. these days you can give an automatic tranny a first gear of something like 5:1 or more, coupled with a differential of around 4:1, which would give you a tremendous multiplication. back in the day, your typical automatic first gear was around 2.45:1 for mopars, and i think around 2.7:1 for gm cars. and then the axles were usually, at the most, around 4-4.5:1. they had to compromise somewhat because of the fewer gears, and not having overdrive to keep the revs down at highway speeds."
2200,"December 13, 2005 7:07AM",british_rover,i would add the sr20 4 cylinder motor from nissan to that list. they went in 1991-1994 se-r sentras a couple of other usdm cars and jdm sylvias(our 240sx's). the engine stock made a little less then 200 hp in naturally aspirated form but the stock crank could support 500 plus horsepower i belive.
2201,"December 13, 2005 9:20AM",jaserb,"not even close on the horsepower. the sr20de motor in a stock us spec se-r was rated at 140 hp, although they may have been slightly under-rated. the later 2000-2002 se 2.0s and infiniti g20s were rated at 145. there was a non us spec, naturally aspirated sr20ve with vvt that came closer to 200 hp.

2203,"December 13, 2005 9:30AM",bumpy,"the sr20 is good, but it's not that good. the sr20de did 140hp in the original se-r, and you can push that up to 150 with free intake, exhaust, and a lighter flywheel. the variable-valve-lift-cam sr20ve did 185hp in the late primera and that can go up to around 200hp with the same mods. the turbo sr20det ran 200-250hp, and those can run up to 400hp or so on the stock internals.

probably the champion in the overbuilt category is the legendary rb26dett from the skyline gt-r. ""officially"" rated at 276hp and running more like 325-350hp stock, it can run up to 500-600hp on the stock internals and modified versions have hit 1000hp on a motor that displaces about 157 c.i. that performance isn't free; the rb weighs about as much as a chevy small block."
2204,"December 13, 2005 9:31AM",andre1969,"but i liked that generation of lumina coupe. the interiors were junky and fall-apart, and things tended to break on the outside as well, but i really admired the basic shape. i thought it had more excitement to it than the '95-99 monte, which was inoffensive but kinda bland, and more together than the '00-05 style, which has curves in all the wrong places and is just an odd mis-mash of different shapes."

one of my friends has a sister with a '92 or '93 sable that her mother handed down to her. they don't know how many miles it has because it's only a 5-digit. i thought by that time most cars had gone to a 6-digit?

once upon a time, wasn't it common to reset the odometer when a new engine was put in a car? i'm thinking like in the 40's or 50's, or before odometer tampering was considered a crime."

popular mechanics, or one of those old magazines, did a dyno test of a dodge dart gts with the 340, an olds (can't remember if it was a 4-4-2 or a fullsize) and some ford engine. it was for one of those articles where they were talking about how horsepower wasn't necessarily all it was cracked up to be.

anyway, the 340 came out the ""truest"". something like 240 hp at the wheels, or around 88%. i think the ford came in at 75% and the olds was really bad, at like 60%.

supposedly, the old 340, while advertised at 275 hp really put out more like 300.

another interesting tidbit...i remember reading an article in c&d or mt, where they tested the new 5.7 mopar hemi by the same standards the old 426 was, and hp came out about the same...425. i wonder what that srt-8 6.1 would gross out at? :surprise:"

2210,"December 13, 2005 11:19AM",Mr_Shiftright,"dyno tests are also often sprinkled liberally with moonshine, because the numbers you get are totally dependent on the skill (or evil intent) of the operator.

you can in fact dial in any hp results you want. i could show you a 400hp dyno slip from a toyota echo----easy to do.

mileages: well there is data that says that the average lifespan of a junked car in america is something like 11 years...of course this includes accidents, etc. so you might say ""no fair"".

but i say ""fair"" because when someone says that he intends to drive his car 400k i always remind him that statistically it is very unlikely he will get there---darn near impossible.....due to accidents, rust and other factors that have nothing to do with the ""overbuilt"" engine or ""rugged driveline"" blah blah blah.

i will also testify here in edmunds car court that i swear that in 25 years of appraising cars, i have never once verified a claim of over 300k on an original untouched engine.

i've done quite a bit of reading up on engine longevity, and most engineers seem to agree that about 175k-225k are the realistic design limits for most modern engines, after which time they might be ""running"" in a fashion but not really up to snuff..."
2214,"December 13, 2005 12:27PM",xwesx,"i'll certainly agree with you on that one. it is a rarity indeed to find an engine that literally has not been ""opened up"" in any way. that means that only that most basic of maintenance items have been replaced - like belts, hoses, etc.

the key to keeping a car running for many many miles (regardless of age) is maintenance, and that will often times mean more work than just oil and the occasional belt. too often these days people think that they should only have to gas it and go, and occasionally take it to a jiffy lube. the moment they start having problems with the car it is the manufacturer's fault and they dump the car for something new.

it's all a balance of course, but $1500 a year on maintenance for a car you own outright is a heck of a lot cheaper than a new car and once you've kept a daily driver for more than 5 years, resale should not even be taken into consideration any more because you've fully depreciated it in a practical sense and anything you get off a sale is basically just salvage on it - a final bonus, if you will. i often hear people say, ""i have a $2,500 repair on this car that is only worth $3,500, so i'm not going to do it."" my response is, ""well, assuming you do that $2,500 repair, how long do you plan to keep it after that? do you think you will have another $2,500 repair in six months to a year?"" $2,500 doesn't buy much car on the 'new' market, so if such a repair is performed and the owner gets another 2-3 years out of it with only ""normal maintenance,"" that's money in the bank right there and you've saved more than you would have made by selling the car now without performing the repair.

as far as accidents.... well, you cannot predict them, but you can plan for them. obviously on a $3,500 car, it doesn't take much to total it, but it might take more than that to keep it from running if you had no other choice."
2215,"December 13, 2005 12:29PM",xwesx,"my father had a '92 camry le with about 230k on it when it was sold out of the family about two years ago. that car's engine had never been opened up, but its tranny died. he and my brother swapped in a new used one, drove it for another 1k or so to feel confident in the operation of the new unit, then sold it. assuming good maintenance from there on out, i would venture to say it could have made it to 300 unopened, but again, entirely dependent on the new owner's driving and maintenance habits and a fair bit of luck!"
2216,"December 13, 2005 12:34PM",lemmer,"how do you fudge dyno numbers? i have heard of little tricks, but not how to ""create"" a 400hp echo."

9 ways to look rich but live cheap

buy classics. at first this sounds like an expensive move; classics always cost more. but for certain purchases, spending more may be a better investment in the long run. &#147;i decided to buy a five-year-old bmw this year,&#148; says sandy denicolais, former fashion and beauty editor of women&#146;s day. &#147;the payments for a brand-new honda were the same. but in five years, that honda won&#146;t be worth as much as my bmw. the bmw will last longer, it&#146;s higher quality, it&#146;s got more style.&#148;"
2220,"December 13, 2005 1:30PM",andre1969,"but what exactly, does a shift kit do for a car? my '76 lemans has one in it, and it's the only car i've ever had with one. it does seem like the tranny shifts much quicker than your typical gm tranny (almost more chrysler-esque), and it'll also downshift much more readily. i've never had a car with a 3-speed automatic that would downshift to second so readily at 70 mph!

would a shift kit improve your hp at the wheels, or does it just make more effective use of the hp that's available?"
2221,"December 13, 2005 1:32PM",andre1969,i wonder if that chick will make the same statement about bmw once the bangled-up ones are 5 years old! :blush:

2223,"December 13, 2005 2:12PM",Mr_Shiftright,"can there be any greater misfortune to befall a human being on this earth than making payments on a car and repairing it at the same time?

if she had paid cash for a very low miles 5 year old bimmer (now well out of warranty) that might be one thing but to finance an old bmw, that's pretty reckless imo.

as for ""investment"", the day the acquisition of an old bmw sedan becomes an investment, let me know...

also she has made a fatal flaw....in five years, the new honda might not be worth as much as her bmw is worth now, but unfortunately, in five years her five year old bmw will be ten years old---lol!

price of a 10 year old 3 series bimmer---maybe $6,000.

price of a 5 year old honda accord lx v-6 sedan...about $10,000

so yeah, she's wrong...by about 80%...and we are presuming the bmw will run without repairs for the next five years.

this is badddddd advice......."

2225,"December 13, 2005 7:15PM",fintail,"well, about 4 years ago i bought a nice 12 year old mb for $7000, drove it til august when i sold it without effort for $5000 (and probably could have got a little more if i tried) and bought the c43. it didn't cost me a fortune in repairs in my time with it. sometimes a nice older car can be ok.

i think the whole ""opening"" an engine requirement to high mileage is too strict. some engines are supposed to be opened for timing chains/belts and valve adjustments etc as part of maintenance."
2226,"December 13, 2005 7:20PM",Mr_Shiftright,"what i meant was literally ""opening"" it up...which includes a cylinder head. you don't open the engine to replace a timing belt or chain for that matter, so that doesn't count. if you had to do a valve job, basically the engine has ""failed"" to remain in factory spec, so no bragging rights allowed. you've ""opened"" it.

this is why i said i can never verify high mileage claims. guy claims ""350k"" but then you find out he blew a head gasket, cracked the original head, etc. ...or did a ring and valve job because it was puking oil. none of this counts as an untouched engine in my book. major failure happened.

old cars are a crap shoot...i've made out on some, got creamed on others...the point is...you never know what's going to happen. and on an old german car, when and if ""it"" happens, that ""it"" is going to hurt and demolish the entire financial equation.

you know, old cars are a nice hobby, not an investment. i'm more than happy to sell the car for somewhere near the price i paid after a couple of years. miles used up are worth money to me after all"
2227,"December 13, 2005 7:24PM",fintail,"oh, i thought you were talking like removing a valve cover or something.

""old cars are a nice hobby, not an investment. ""

exactly...that's why i have the fintail...i'm not seeking profit, i just like a fun toy, and as it hasn't been in daily service for several years, all i really pay for is basic maintenance, as it is reliable."

okay, then i almost made it with a '88 sentra; popped the head gasket at 296k but it had been wheezing a while before that. i think the only decent candidates for the shiftright 300k club are late-80s civics, accords, and sentras that spent the overwhelming majority of their life in 5th gear. i wonder if the computer keeps a lifetime rpm counter?"
2229,"December 13, 2005 7:51PM",bumpy,"the shift kit replaces the springs and stuff in the control valves to bump up the fluid pressure in various places in the tranny, thus quicker shifts and more aggressive kickdowns. the kit itself does nothing for power throughput, but it is often accompanied by a better torque converter with a good lockup, and that can route a few more horses to the axle. if you're a patient sort, you can buy the tranny maintenance manual off ebay and read through it."
2230,"December 13, 2005 8:31PM",Mr_Shiftright,i don't think there's an old honda alive that can hold a head gasket for 300k---great cars but head gaskets were not their forte iirc.

one of my neighbors has a first-gen 750il, not sure what year, but probably about the same. it's his main family car (there other is an old saturn sl, go figure), it replaced an early '80s v8 dodge pickup; so the guy is a bit, um, eccentric in his vehicle choices. sad thing, the bimmer probably uses about as much gas as the dodge truck, but costs about five times as much to repair (and has five times as many things to go wrong)."

the 240sx, on the other hand, is on the short list of cars i would like to resto-mod (although its a little young to warrant restoration, even if it is 15 years old). take the truck motor in there and boost it, or use it for a boat anchor and get an sr20det."
2281,"December 18, 2005 9:27AM",andre1969,"actually, i think it's pretty tasteful as far as interiors go. i like the way the dash has a bit of a driver's orientation with the shape of the gauges and such. and it's nice to have a dash with a round speedo instead of a horizontal job where the middle numbers are all scrunched together. and real gauges!

nice color combo too, with the nightwatch exterior and dark blue velour interior. i think these interiors look classy in velour, but leather in the wrong color looks a bit too bordello. i'd change the wheels, too. chrysler had some good looking sport wheels for their rwd cars back then. usually you saw them on miradas and cordobas, but they're a direct swap to the nyer and anything else rwd on the 4.5"" bolt pattern.

and they are heavy, solid cars. from the specs i've seen, the '83-89 nyer/5th ave weighed around 3750 lb. for comparison, the big 79-81 nyers weren't much more, at 3850. routine handling isn't so hot, because they were set up to feel like a big luxury car. for some reason though, emergency handling on them was, according to cr when they tested one, very good. these cars did have a wide track though, and usually came with fairly large tires and rims, as domestic cars go. 7"" rims, in an era when many cars this size often ran on 5.5-6"" rims."
2282,"December 18, 2005 4:37PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i'm sorry andre, i do not wish to pound on your beloved by any means, but the interior looks like a bordello to me and the design is sheer chaos to my eyes. i think the fact that no automaker has ever harkened back to any of it sort of implies that this type of design did not really thrill the hearts of millions.

since the topic is about restoring things, i don't find this type of car worthy of restoration for the reasons stated. but i'm not saying you're not allowed to like it of course! :p"

2286,"December 19, 2005 10:08AM",andre1969,"well, i drove an '89 gran fury ex police car for years, and i had no problems with the way it handled or performed or rode. i did hate the way it ate those little lightweight starters on a regular basis, and the gm carb on it (these things switched from carters to rochesters for 1985) was cranky. and gas mileage was bad...around 10-13 around town with an appetite for premium, although it could break 20 on the highway (epa estimate was a sad 13/15)

and my uncle had driven it a few times...he said he hated the way it rode. of course, it's going to ride rougher than a civvy model though, and mine had extra heavy duty shocks on it.

i'd say my biggest complaint about it was the steering wheel location...while the sucker had great legroom, the steering wheel was a bit too close for comfort. the back seat was also thinly padded, although the front seat seemed to fit me fine. excellent visibility, too, with its low beltline and tall roof. even those thick looking c-pillars didn't hamper visibility much, although a 5th ave would be much worse in this area, since the quarter windows in the doors were covered over, and the c-pillars were extended and blocked up.

and don't let lemko get wind of this...he had an '85 5th ave that he absolutely loved. sold it to his brother, and it's still running strong. i'm sure he'd have a few nice things to say about it. :shades:"

2293,"December 19, 2005 4:11PM",Mr_Shiftright,700 hp? i don't think so. half that sounds about right given the specs.
2294,"December 19, 2005 4:25PM",lilengineerboy,"actually, stock is about half that. an hks turbo kit, the piggyback fuel system and some bigger injectors (and some tuning) and you are easily between 500 and 700. supras can get close to 900 on pump gas. amazingly robust blocks, those things have.
http://www.sportcompactcarweb.com/events/0403scc_supras/index.html 700 doesn't seem sooo out of reach."
2295,"December 19, 2005 4:40PM",Mr_Shiftright,"stock hp is 320 so lets say optimistically 35% increase with a hot turbo and say 10% for all the rest...that's about 450hp and that's about right i think for a stock motor. this presumes of course the car hasn't been beat to death.

the motors you are talking about are way beyond stock...maybe the outline of the block is there, sure, but that's not my idea of stock. you need tremendous strenthening once you approach 500 hp.

given that this is a street car one remains highly skeptical of such claims."
2296,"December 19, 2005 5:08PM",lilengineerboy,"i agree with the skepticism, and i think anytime a car is highly modified its valid, but the claims are not so outrageous. one of the things about turbo cars though is just turning up the boost gets pretty substantial gains (up to the point it blows the head gasket or burns a hole in a piston from getting fuel starved). bigger turbos, fuel system and tuning i think would go a long way, but there is no evidence that car has been tuned.

thats another thing, just because you buy the same parts that the magazine car has, doesn't mean you are making the same power unless the tuning is there.
i also think that these guys don't realize heavy modifications often lower the value of the car. this guy traded his car into a dealer, so that makes me think he just wanted to get out from under it, or it was never tuned properly.

these cars are the japanese muscle cars of the 90s, more so that the 300zx, 3000gt and certainly the rx7. they were over engineered and leave a lot of room for improvement/modification. exhaust, a downpipe, and boost controller will get you to 400 with stock turbos. it seems somewhere between 500 and 600 is the limit for the bottom end, with those 900hp guys having custom rods and pistons."

2306,"December 20, 2005 10:32AM",andre1969,"hmmm, now we know why the general lee was a charger and not a nova! :surprise:

still, i guess if it was the right engine, like a hopped-up 350, the driveline of that nova should be worth something. and i'm sure it's worth something as a parts car. the '75-79 nova is pretty popular as a streetrod, and you can put a big block in them, so there is some demand for them. not as much as the '68-74 style, though."

2. the bid is a shill

2310,"December 20, 2005 1:14PM",lilengineerboy,"while i agree that the one in question is ugly as sin, i also think they are a lot of fun. the 95-97 se had really deep bucket seats, selecting a 5spd got you 4 wheel disk brakes, and that 170 hp v6. the car was mostly benign but did have some oversteer if provoked, which made it a lot of fun for a fwd car.
bad things were lucas electronics (light switch, a?c controls), and water pumps, which isn't exactly its fault. most japanese cars use a timing belt, so since you are paying $450-500 to take the whole thing apart, you replace the water pump as a matter of course ""while you are in there."" the contour/mystake/cougar use a timing chain with no scheduled replacement, so the water pumps actually fail for end of life, as opposed to being replaced because they are a pita to get to.
the worst thing is even the 200hp svt contour version lacked a limited slip, something that separated the men from the boys and gave nissan the edge over honda in the early 90s, and why the svt focus was a joke next to the se-r and neon srt-4."

a show car can bring $40k or more, but again, this isn't a matching #s, so you can take $5k at least off value.

four speed is good.

if i were bidding, i'd want all the engine, date code, and casting #s off the engine---if it was from a much later car, like a 1970, i'd penalize the value even more. if it were a real and contemporary (same year) 396/375hp, i might not penalize the value very much at all.

paint is wrong color, interior looks like wrong seats and wheel....phew...this baby needs a lot of work.

by 1983 they were getting pretty outmoded compared to newer fwd models from gm and chrysler, but you could still do far worse in a car choice. still, i guess $2900 is awfully high for something like this, no matter what condition it's in. but then, who knows? maybe there's someone out there who puts the '83 fairmont on a pedestal the same way i do it with the '76 lemans! :p oh well, if nothing else it does look like it's in nice shape, and at least has a clean, handsome look about it."

how much hp would a 1972 304 have? i found some specs for the 1974, and it had 150 hp/245 ft-lb of torque, so i'd imagine the 1972 one would be similar. while that's not spectacular, at least it's not as embarrasing as some of those 135 hp 318's, 129 hp 302's, and 150 hp 400's! :blush:"

there were some pretty beefy optional engines available though...the 400-4bbl with 255 hp, the 440-4bbl with 280 hp, and the 440 6-pack with 330 hp. there was also a 340-4bbl, and later a 360-4bbl that put out around 245 hp, but i'm not sure if they were offered in the charger in '72."

i'm guessing this car isn't worth it from a monetary standpoint, but grandpa bought it new and it will be passed through the family. my friend sent nice, big pictures, and the scary part is from pictures the car looks flawless. it looks like something you would see on ebay represented as a near perfect original car."

still, they weren't bad cars...sturdy and tank-like, and the somewhat smallish size and torsion-bar suspension probably gave them a handling advantage over the competition at buick, olds, and mercury.

anyway, it was mainly offered in the chevelle ss396, and was still referred to the ss396 even with the 402. i think it also went into the nova in limited quantities. i've seen it in the occasional big chevy, usually a caprice but occasionally an impala. the monte may have used it as well.

(i wasn't around then, but looked it up online) they sold it back around feb/march for $475,000.

i wonder how much a nicely preserved eldo brougham would have appreciated over the same time. it's interesting how many people want to put a car away for a long time to preserve it, thinking it'll be worth a fortune. fwiw, accounting for inflation $13333 comes out to around $87500 today.

btw i prefer the '58 eldo brougham to those overblown '59's as well. although the 1959 eldo brougham was very cleanly styled, and ultimately served as a preview of what the '61-62 caddies would look like."

i've seen a few in the dupont registry before and they have very high asking prices. other than their exclusivity and possible history (belonging to heads of state) was there anything special about them. they looked like a stretched version of the s class back of that time (w108,w109?).

if it was by me, i would probably take a flyer on it at this price, but i also have been known for a lack of common sense at times.

i don't care about ac on an old car like this, but it seems odd to have the compressor redone, but not have it charged up.

as to the others, the 912 is a money pit and the 356 a parts car at best 9and maybe not even that). other than the color, the replica actually looks like the best of the bunch! he obviously wants at least 7k for it (minimum bid), and i suppose you could do worse for th emoney.

the bed on my uncle's '76 was so rusted out that he pulled it off and actually built a wooden bed for it. i remember us putting the old steel bed up on top and hauling it to the dump. don't ask how just the two of us got it up there, because my memory's blocking it out now! my uncle can be pretty creative about things like that.

otherwise, the cab and front-end clip were still pretty solid, although it had some rust holes in the doors where someone had mounted trailer mirrors. he ultimately sold the thing to one of his buddies down in the appalachians, and that guy still uses it as a farm truck.

it was a heavy sucker, too. i think we calculated that it weighed close to 5,000 pounds (took the weight on the dump scale, and subtracted out my weight and my uncle's). in comparison my '85 silverado, which is a bigger truck, is only around 4200 lb. oh, the jeep was 4wd, so that was probably part of it. forgot about that little detail :blush:"
2434,"January 5, 2006 7:25AM",andre1969,"why should a benz limo be much more difficult to maintain than a regular sedan? did they use unique engines, trannies, brakes, etc? i could understand having more electrical problems, as you'd have more lighting, power assists, etc, and there'd be a lot of unique, rare trim pieces, but why the other stuff?

at least with an imperial, caddy, or lincoln limo, the engine and tranny was usually no different from its sedan counterpart. usually they just stuck a quicker rear-end in it so that the extra weight didn't bog it down so bad."
2435,"January 5, 2006 7:38AM",fintail,"on the 600, the engine was special, a fairly limited production unit that now has monstrous running costs - makes a normal mb v8 look like maintaining a civic. i am sure shifty knows the real specifics, but common items like a starter or ignition components are priced to hilarity. add in air suspension, pneumatic central locking, electric accessories, and all of the wood trim, and you're in for a project.

from my experience with period mb anyway, the transmissions are the least of ones worries. they usually hold up pretty well.

i can agree with that ghia limo idea too, those are really cool and kind of evil looking. there's just something about some old limos...they speak of exotic and elegant, where new ones are a joke."
2436,"January 5, 2006 7:45AM",stickguy,"gives me an idea. take something like the benz limo (one with mechanical needs), and rebuild it with modern components (the old chevy v8 in a porsche trick).

difference being, it might be a better car, and actually affordable to run. plus more reliable. basically you are keeping the cool/stylish part, and getting rid of the tourblemaking pieces.

i know it will be expensive, but at least it will look cool.

i remember seeing a few other cars done like this (a 1940ish caddy or some such other rare period limo)."
2437,"January 5, 2006 7:56AM",lemmer,"i was going to have my fil check out that 944 in orlando, but it already sold with ""buy it now."" oh well, looking is the fun part anyway."
2438,"January 5, 2006 8:02AM",fintail,"i've thought about that too...if you have a 600 with a shot engine, it would probably be cheaper to retrofit a new corvette engine into it than rebuild the original powertrain anyway. resto-rods are kind of cool. same idea about putting a v12 in a fintail etc. the key is to make it a sleeper. the latter would involve enormous sums of money....but if you've got it...it's cooler than pimping out an escalade."
2439,"January 5, 2006 8:04AM",andre1969,"would there be a benz engine that's fairly common, and more ecnomical to maintain, that would be a direct swap into the limo's engine compartment?"
2440,"January 5, 2006 8:08AM",lemmer,"german cars seem to have so much complicated stuff. the engine is usually just the beginning. i know very little about transplanting stuff, but what if the braking and steering systems are part of the problem? at some point, it might be easier to bolt the bez body on to a gm chassis, and at that point why bother?"
2441,"January 5, 2006 8:33AM",fintail,"the most economical mb engines are modern 6 cyl units, especially the one in the 80s and early 90s e class, and some diesels too...probably not good choices for a large vehicle, as my old s class had that 6, and it was no screamer.

perhaps an amg tuned v8 could do...they are handbuilt and seem to be pretty reliable...common no, and economical no.

i don't know of braking and steering being especially problematic...unless you are working them around a transplanted engines. the german engines are just so expensive to fix if they are ran down. i'll see a used c43 engine offered at $7500, and a full proper rebuild on a v8 will run you well over 10k"
2442,"January 5, 2006 8:38AM",stickguy,"trying to be practical about this? where's the fun in that?

besides, some people spend rediculous amounts on crappy cars (like the pimped out escalades), so you might as well get something unique out of it. besides, a pullman with a bad engine and other needs is probably a 1k car to start with, so you have plenty of room to work with.

that, and you will stand out in a crowd."
2443,"January 5, 2006 11:03AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah i think you'd have to be a rocket scientist to convert a 600 pullman into anything else. this is not ""hijacked"" technology using welding torches and sledge hammers. the 600s are incredibly complex with hydraulic pneumatic suspension, hydraulic windows and seats and locks using piping that withstands 2500 psi (!!!)...all of which are supported with hydraulic pumps running off the engine... i mean, you could do anything if you threw enough money at it, but what's the point? you can just throw $10,000 a year at the stock pullman and probably keep it running decently enough for short trips somewhere.

nah a caddy or chrysler limo has none of the prestige of these cars in the ""higher"" social circles---not even close---a caddy limo is a prom car or airport limo for goodness sake. eye appeal is different than prestige remember. anybody who is rich knows a 60s caddy limo costs $5,000. won't work. but you might impress the locals if that's your goal, sure.

keeping a 60s cadillac running isn't all that easy, either btw, but parts are more readily available so that's good."
2444,"January 5, 2006 11:57AM",stickguy,might as well do it right and get a 1940 or so model and do a resto mod on it (modern running gear and all that). you get the style on something that can actually be driven.
2445,"January 5, 2006 12:10PM",Mr_Shiftright,"now that's a good idea! you'd need to figure out how to build an engine big enough to move all that weight but yet not a ""rude"" engine--the car should be reasonably quiet.

i've seen american v-8s in various benzes and they just don't work...something just basically incompatible that seems to ruin both the american v-8 and the german car simultaneously. not a good result for all that work. of course, we know they work in british sports cars!"
2446,"January 5, 2006 12:14PM",andre1969,"or early 70's caddy mill, like a 472 or 500 be enough to move a '40 or so caddy limo? i dunno what a '40 limo would weigh compared to a late 60's/early 70's caddy, but i'm sure switching from the big lump of a 40's engine to the 472/500 would probably save a pretty good chunk of weight."
2447,"January 5, 2006 12:40PM",fintail,"how about a limo like that ca.38-ish caddy limo i posted from ebay? that has some presence.

this car looks nicer than average, but the license plate is the good part"

2449,"January 5, 2006 12:48PM",stickguy,"i think that was the one that i was thinking about.

shouldn't be hard, since american full size cars didn't change much between 1940 and 1970."
2450,"January 5, 2006 1:51PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well let's see a 1971 caddy engine is rated at about 375 hp and a 40 caddy limo weighs 5,290 pounds (oof!) so that gives you a 1:14 power to weight....not too bad, not too bad....just keep the wheels straight at all times :p"
2451,"January 5, 2006 2:08PM",fintail,"is that car rusty or anything? you live in a rust area, don't you?

that would be my main reservation...mb enthusiasts usually have a picky eye and the really good older cars tend be passed from one enthusiast to another.

would a 71 caddy weigh more than 5100 lbs? i like some of the really deluxe packards too, like those brunn models."
2452,"January 5, 2006 2:20PM",andre1969,"it looks like most caddies were running around 4600-4800 lb, although the fleetwood was just under 5000 lb and the fleetwood 75 was around 5300 lb. they porked up fast after that though. by 1973 the lightest caddy was the calais hardtop coupe, which started at 4900 lb. by '75 it was up to 5003 lb.

it's amazing that the same basic body could pork up by roughly 400 lb over the course of 4 years? did those 5 mph bumpers really add that much weight? i know there was more emissions crap too but c'mon, how much weight does a catalytic convertor, that vapor recovery cannister, and a bunch of vacuum hoses really add? maybe more sound insulation, too?"
2453,"January 5, 2006 4:19PM",Mr_Shiftright,it's just bad engineering.
2454,"January 5, 2006 9:17PM",fintail,"i assume ""rear seal"" is a rear main seal...these cars aren't so common anymore"
2455,"January 6, 2006 7:03AM",british_rover,there might be a seperate rear seal for the oil pan but it is impossible to tell till you actually take the oil pan off or pull the engine/tranny.
2456,"January 6, 2006 7:23AM",andre1969,"would most likely have that lightweight 3-speed ""slim-jim"" roto-hydramatic, or whatever they call it. instead of being a 4-speed like the old hydramatic, this one was 3 speeds with a torque convertor. supposedly it was very troublesome.

i don't know if you could swap in an older hydramatic, because they were physically a larger unit. back then, even though an olds, buick, pontiac, chevy, or caddy might have used the same basic body, they'd still alter the floorpan, dependent on which transmission the cars used. the old hydramatic was a longer tranny, and i believe had the pump at the rear, so the body needed a different floorpan.

now the newer thm350 and 400 might swap in, and they were plenty durable. i've heard that the slim jim is a tranny to be avoided, though."
2457,"January 6, 2006 7:23AM",lemko,"i've seen no external rust or signs of putty on the body. underneath, i don't know. i haven't come close enough that the guy might be watching from his house and pounce on me thinking he had a buyer.

as for the weight of a 1971 cadillac, i had a 1975 cadillac sedan deville and it weighed 5,028 lbs. a fleetwood may weigh more than 5,100."
2458,"January 6, 2006 8:37AM",fintail,"i'd be scared of that old mb...the pessimist in me tells me there is something wrong if it has been for sale for so long.

did those caddys have a frame made of cast iron or something?

i kind of like that 63 olds...the fullsize gm coupes of that time (impalas etc too) were pretty elegant in their own way. gm was able to make big not look bloated."
2459,"January 6, 2006 8:47AM",bumpy,"""bad rear seal"" is probably the main bearing seal on the crankshaft, which means you get to pull and rebuild the engine. while you're at it, toss the slim jim and throw in a big-block powerglide. otherwise, it's a nice, cleanly-styled car; definitely a keeper."

i wonder if this sucker might have been a police car? it's kind of an odd color, and does have the big engine and little dog-dish hubcaps, but then it also has cloth seats. still, i guess there's no law saying a police car can't have cloth seats! would air conditioning have been a rarity on a copcar back in the 70's, though?"

my uncle chuckie had a gray 1967 ford econoline van in college. it was an old pp&l truck (pennsylvania power and light based in allentown, pa). i thought it was really neat with the engine compartment between the front seats. you could sit a third person on the enigine cover - the best place for winter as that all-metal interior was pretty cold. i guess you could say the econoline came with the first heated seat!"

i might go look at it...if anything, i might know someone else who would want it. i really don't want to have to store 2 cars, but it looks real cheap if it isn't rusty."
2489,"January 11, 2006 12:15PM",xwesx,"freakshow?!? no no..... these old mid-sixties chevy/ford vans were sharp units, though i agree that they are probably among the worst vehicles in which to be involved in an accident. i'd take one of these over, say, a metro or justy, though!

ultimately i prefer the '69-'74 econoline over these, though i wouldn't mind having that '65 chevy! 1974 was the last year ford made a decent looking van. chevys looked nice up to... ah heck, now i am unsure when they upgraded... was it '89 at the same time as their pickup? i think it was later. anyway, i digress....."
2490,"January 11, 2006 12:20PM",andre1969,"any of those flat-faced vans...just too scary for my tastes! i thought that dodge/plymouth made a good looking van in the 70's, and the 80's versions looked good until they ended up going with those composite headlights.

the chevy vans were good looking too in the 70's and 80's. it was when they tried to put that pickup truck-looking front end on them, with the quad headlights side-by side instead of stacked, that i thought they started looking bad. it looked bad just by itself, but being grafted onto something that was designed in the 70's just made it worse. i also never really cared for the newer chevy vans, the ones that were redesigned around 1995, to finally be able to accommodate a big-block engine."
2491,"January 11, 2006 2:24PM",lemko,"...you forgot about the '60s dodge vans with the big round headlight bezels. weren't they based on the compact dart? my uncle chuckie bought a new 1977 dodge van when he graduated from college. that van was still runnning 20 years later. obviously the ziebart rust treatment kept it from rotting away. funny. whatever happened to ziebart and rusty jones, etc.?"
2492,"January 11, 2006 4:20PM",xwesx,"the only thing scary about them are the drivers... you have to have a healthy respect for what you are driving and a fair bit of competency behind the wheel to boot!

i also liked the dodge van of that era. none of the ""newer"" vans are visually worth a hoot any more, and ford hasn't done it right since '75, though their '75 to whenever-they-redesigned-it was by far the worst! i'd rank gm's current version a close second.

full-size vans are just such versitile vehicles, it is difficult for me not to like them. the only disadvantage they have is the fully covered top (also their greatest advantage... figures....) if a manufacturer could come up with a well-designed and practical fold-a-top van, it would be the perfect work vehicle - capable of towing bumper or 5th, hauling covered or uncovered... it would be quite the vehicle.... and quite the ungainly contraption!!!!"
2493,"January 11, 2006 6:02PM",Mr_Shiftright,first thing you need to do is take a compression test. those engines will burn valves regularly if they aren't adjusted periodically. also the cylinder head surface itself corrodes from age and neglect (not flushing coolant) and the head gasket won't seal any longer.
2494,"January 11, 2006 7:12PM",fintail,"that reminds me, i need to put a coolant flush on the fintail's to-do list this year, along with maybe a valve adjustment. she's gonna have some dough sunk into her this year, as she's going to get a full tune-up and some other minor work done too.

first nuance: the '82s are desireable because they are fuel-injected (more power, run way better, better fuel mileage, more reliable).

second nuance: low miles are a very very good thing on a fiat, as one fiat mile equals three ordinary car miles."
2497,"January 12, 2006 2:12PM",ghulet,"yeah, i forgot about the fi thing with fiats (unfortunately, my parents had an '80 fiat brava, which i think was carbureated). still, could it possibly be worth $8000, and in mid-winter chicago? i'm guessing not.

limos strike me as one of those things every collector, at one time or another, thinks they want, though they end up being nightmares (finding those model-specific body and interior parts, paying for gas, securing sufficient storage space, electrical maladies, etc.). the price seems reasonable enough, though, especially considering the body condition."

i also remember oldsmobile making a big deal out of their 90th anniversary. evidently, george burns turned 90 the same year olds did, and they used him in some advertising.

my grandma's '85 lesabre limited was a ""collector's edition"". i think technically, all limiteds that year were. i doubt too many people are collecting them, although they were good cars, and had a nice, clean, upscale look to them. but it was still just a car, and not a museum piece. still, at the time, the end of the line for the ""traditional"" full-sized buick. that type of car was really coming back into demand around 1984-85, but because of cafe regs, and designs gm had set into motion when everybody thought gasoline would be $3.00 per gallon and in short supply forever, it was the type of car gm was phasing out. as i recall, the lesabre was the #18 selling car in the us in 1985, and the vast majority of them were collector's editions, so it served its purpose. remember, the auto makers weren't building these things with the thought that we'd give a damn about them 20-30 years later. all they cared is that the new car buying public wanted them.

so, if nothing else, the ""collector's edition"" stuff gave them a little more to hype up at the time for new car buyers. incidentally, when the '96 roadmaster went out of production, they ran a ""collector's edition"" series. they still had a bunch of hood ornaments left over from the '85 lesabre, in storage all those years, that they used up for it. oh, and the collector's edition lesabre did come with a nice package of literature, bound in a simulated leather case, which showcased the lesabre over the years. reading it, you'd almost think that 1985 was the end of the lesabre nameplate itself, and not just the end of the b-body coupe and sedan.

those collector's edition continentals back in the late 70's did make sense at the time, as there were still a lot of people that wanted a true mastodon like that, and swore they'd never buy a downsized car. however, the auto makers just couldn't build those huge beasts anymore. lincoln especially definitely got their money's worth out of them, when they were new.

from what i've heard, another special edition from the 70's that equated to a ton of profit was the 1978 diamond jubilee mark v. supposedly they stickered for around $20,000, in an era where a base mark v was around $12k. the diamond jubilee may not be worth all the much more today (although don't tell that to my buddy who's infatuated with them), but at the time, it was pure marketing genius."
2511,"January 15, 2006 2:21PM",Mr_Shiftright,"it's worth an extra $2,000 or so over a base coupe (whoopee).

actually mark iii, iv & vs are holding fairly steady value and have bottomed out in depreciation...but they are a hard, hard sell, especially if you don't live near florida or las vegas. easily worth double of a mark vi. my appraisal would be that the best v in the world is worth maybe $8,000, and a jubilee $10k. but we are talking stunning cars here. any glitches, damage, high miles, deduct massively."

2513,"January 16, 2006 1:21PM",jrosasmc,"oldsmobile's 85th anniversary was indeed in 1982. the company was founded in 1897.

speaking of olds, i spotted an '87 cutlass supreme sedan for sale up the road from my neighborhood. it's advertised as a 2-owner car with 89k miles. unfortunately the ad said it had the 3.8-liter v-6...a dreaded engine. andre were there any major differences between the '87 motor and the one in your '82 cutlass?"
2514,"January 16, 2006 1:23PM",fintail,"that caddy has to be a steal at that price. a major service on many modern cars can run that much.

hahahahahahahahahaha"
2515,"January 16, 2006 1:53PM",jlawrence01,"for $850, that is a steal ... if it runs ..."
2516,"January 16, 2006 2:20PM",au94,"lemme get this straight, somebody did that to that car on purpose?!?!?!"
2517,"January 16, 2006 3:11PM",fintail,"and paid a lot to do it, too.

if that's not a pimpmobile, i don't know what is. embarassing, but almost fascinating in its badness."
2518,"January 16, 2006 3:41PM",andre1969,"ah, i see you remember the horror stories i told of my '82 cutlass supreme! :surprise: my understanding is that the 231 got an entirely new, stronger block for 1985. the main reason for this was because the turbo version was really jumping in horsepower, and the block needed to be beefed up. the more mundane versions benefitted from this stronger block, as well. i think the new block also eliminated all of the problems the older design had with lubrication.

supposedly the old block had all sorts of right angles in the oil passages, which would cut down the oil pressure, especially as the engines became older and the passages became more clogged.

i'm not sure what else changed between '82 and '87 in the 231. the fuel injected versions got more powerful, going from 125 to 150 hp for 1986, and soon thereafter to 170 hp, but the 2-bbl carb, which was used in the cutlass supreme, had 110 hp right up through the end.

so an '87 cutlass supreme would probably be reliable enough, just slow. still, if you really wanted something like this, i'd hold out for a v-8."
2519,"January 17, 2006 10:00AM",fintail,i guess not the worst deal

on second thought, might be better to buy it after someone else spends 20k restoring a car that is only worth 10k when it is done."
2523,"January 17, 2006 1:19PM",andre1969,"how hard it would be to find a ""proper"" gas tank for that caddy? perhaps any '67-68 b/c body tank would work? station wagons might be a bit different, and there were some significant changes in '66 and '69, so those might not work. still, i don't think a gas tank should be too hard to find. it would probably be harder to find one for something like my '79 nyer."
2524,"January 17, 2006 1:26PM",stickguy,"but for more common cars like mustang, chevelle, etc. you can buy just about every part you need right out of a catalog."
2525,"January 17, 2006 1:37PM",andre1969,"is when i needed new ball joints for my '67 catalina, i had to get them specifically for a 1967-68 full-sized pontiac. not a '66, not a '69, and not a chevy, buick, or olds. that's one thing i missed about mopars...they'd use one part and stick to it...for decades!!

i don't know if my '68 dart and '57 desoto use the same ball joint (i'd actually hope not, considering the desoto has about 1000 lb on the dart!), but i do remember them being the same price in the kanter catalog!

also, even though that '67 caddy is a c-body and my catalina is a b-body, the shape of the convertible top looks very similar to me. now in 4-door models i know the c-body was larger inside, with a correspondingly longer roof...but perhaps on the 2-door styles, like the hardtop and convertible, the interiors were the same size, so they could use the same structural parts in them?"

2527,"January 17, 2006 4:03PM",Mr_Shiftright,"old cadillacs are very expensive and difficult to restore as compared to a mustang. that's why most of the old cadillacs, unless they are pristine survivors, will be junked....value isn't even close to cost of restoration unless they are 50s convertibles....and even then it's touch and go. there's no big aftermarket for cadillac...you have to hunt down every little piece and there are a lot of pieces."

they had a pristine '77 pontiac lemans canam sport coupe that went for north of $20k! i think the car only had 4-5k on it. 403 with 185hp, iirc.

i wonder how one of these would perform with the 403? i've read road tests of the can am with the 400-4bbl and 200 hp (the 403/185 hp was used in california, high altitude areas, and other regions that were stricter on smog requirements), and it did 0-60 in around 8.6 seconds as i recall.

did you happen to catch the 70's jag xj-c coupe? i caught the end of it. i guess it had been modified/hot rodded, but i couldn't really tell what had been done with the little bit i caught. i'm one of the few probably who likes the xj coupes, but i do not like the rubber bumpers (ugh). looks so much better with the early models chrome bumpers."

2542,"January 19, 2006 7:48AM",andre1969,"partly because they are ugly! in fact, nowadays i'll often say a car has a ""1961 desoto complex"" when it has a double grille effect, like the aztek, where the upper grille has nothing in common, stylistically, with the lower grille. often cars that have a regular grille between the headlight, but then have a sub-grille/lower air intake get this afflication as well. it's actually very common on ""type-r"" cars! :p

years ago, i read somewhere (national desoto club, i think) that the 1961 desoto actually had the best survival rate of any year desoto. in total numbers, the 1950, 1953 and 1955-56 are very common, but those were also good years for desoto when they were in production.

i guess there were just a lot of people who wanted the last desoto. last time i checked a price guide, i think the '61 is worth a bit more than the '60. the '60 is a better car though, as it's way better looking, and has either a 295 hp 361 or 305 hp 383 (a 330 hp cross-ram was optional), while the 1961 had a toned-down 265 hp 361."

not sure why it would be more valuable for having spent years as a local drag race car (hey, i used to race my parents horizon, does that count?)

looks sharp, but i wonder if it is the original engine? did they keep it all those years when it was running a race motor?

but, it is the real deal. after all, the owner said so!"
2545,"January 19, 2006 10:58AM",Mr_Shiftright,"it's not worth that kind of money, no way not even close. it's maybe a $100k car if it all checks out perfectly. it's not that rare, they made around 4,500 ls6s that year. it's not like some of the mopar hemis where they made 10 or 12 of a certain car.

how 'bout this? it's bidding is pretty healthy for what is basically a basket case, but how many '65 starfire 4-speed convertibles can there be left in the world (total production something like 2200)? seller says it has a 455, which is not factory correct--these came with a 425--and a muncie transmission, but then goes on to say the engine was 'gone through in the '70s, basically leading one to believe that it's original. also, the assertion that it's only 'one of 4 all power starfires built' is wrong--maybe the seller meant 'one of 4 four-speed convertibles built (all starfires had power steering, brakes and windows, for one, and most, if not all, had a power seat, so the 'all power' thing is just blather); in any case, this is an ill-informed seller, but the car at least is interesting and rare. it looks complete, straight, and appears the 4-speed is original, judging by the console with the shift pattern plate. anyway:

fin, i agree, i'd way rather have something a bit obscure (but nothing anyone would make a clone out of!) like a 4-speed starfire convertible than any chevelle convertible. i think the starfire may be hard to find parts for (though many interior and exterior parts are interchangable with other olds) and expensive to restore, but driving around in a cool car worth maybe $30-40k would be more fun than hauling a half million dollar car around on a trailer!"

it's all in people's heads. fascinating.

i do find some of the prices that come across at barret-jackson to be surprisingly high. it really does seem like people don't want to leave empty handed from that auction so they pay more than they would elsewhere. must really get caught up in the moment and excitement."
2557,"January 20, 2006 8:12AM",stickguy,"must be a special case. some of the prices are probably because the cars are the cream of the crop, and others are from auction fever (and too many buyers chasing too few cars).

probably true that peple with money to burn that spent $350 for a buyers pass want to take something home.

that jag was at least a 4 speed car, but a nasty brown. of course, i have no idea how hard it is to find a nice one out in the real world.

i didn't see a benz 180? that i recall. there was 280 3.5 (the big convert) that went fairly high, and i think a red 280sl (1971) that might have done in the 70s.

even with the prices, there still have to be plenty of people that don't come close to recovering the rediculous amount they spent on the restoration.

there was a good sidebar on hemi prices. a confessed close '68ish gtx (orig. 440 car iirc) went for about 110k, but an original hemi only pulled 60k. big difference seems to be that the clone was all spiffed up and shiny, but the real car was very original with ""patina"".

i guess that shows what many bidders focus on. the pricing probably wouldn't work out the same if they were sold through hemmings or some normal channel."

you may be right. i was going to say 280, but then changed it. in any case, still doesn't change my thinking that over $70k is just insane on this car. am i wrong? what is so great about it? i don't find it particulary pretty, nor is it any kind of great performer. so what's the deal? i'd much rather have a new slk."

2569,"January 20, 2006 11:17AM",Mr_Shiftright,"also you have to keep in mind that some of the bids you are seeing are ""chandelier bids"", that is, phony bids done to save face for the auction. they hate ""no bids"" on cars or very low bids on a high reserve. so if the reserve is $100k, and the only real bids are $20k, the auction company will throw in a bid on a shill for $90k and then say ""not sold"", reserve not met. also sometimes a seller puts his car at no reserve and the bids are so low he has to bid on his own car to keep it (and pays the auction fees but of course doesn't have to buy the car himself).

then, too, you will often see a car selling for $80k at b-j being offered for $55k a few months later.

if the high-priced car isn't rare, documented or authentic, what you pay at b-j is definitely not going to pass the test of time.

some guys have a bit too much to drink and they know their buddies are watching them on tv...and besides, if you have 100 million bucks, bidding $80,000 is like getting the car for free. it's like you or me buying a candy bar."

2578,"January 21, 2006 9:56AM",lilengineerboy,"i really don't like these big televised auctions. it is like those reality tv shows that aren't really reality. just because some billionaire paid $200,000 for a vw bug that marilyn monroe farted one day doesn't mean every tapped out '73 super beetle is worth 200k (totally made up example). thats why its on tv, and thats why its newsworthy, it doesn't happen every day. otherwise the whole auction would be selling 2 year old cpo toyota camarys.
i think its interesting, but those cars, are for the most part, not the cars we see on ebay and craigslist or autotrader (or even hemmings, for the most part). those cars have pedigree and were restored or stored by someone who presumably knew what they were doing.
the beater el camino with more bondo than metal doesn't end up there, and getting one in that condition for $10k because ""one just like it restored went for 50k @ bj"" is not a good deal (again, made up example).
its neat to see some of the rare cars, and the cars in #1 original condition with no restoration, but that ultra rare yanko camaro isn't the same as the '67 rust bucket in middle america's back yard.
and as long as i'm venting a little, resto-mods aren't restored vehicles, they are artistic interpretations of cars. i am definitely not saying that as a bad thing, again, its just not that '83 camaro someone put a cop car lt1 in when they blew the head gasket on the 305. a resto-mod at that level is a piece of art, each one is totally original, like having a signed painting. these aren't the same as the 88 crx with a b16a swaps on ebay, either.
i guess the bottom line is, its worth what someone will pay for it, and there is a sucker born every minute, but i wouldn't re-finance my house to buy and restore that basket case 6 cylinder chevelle just yet, at least not expecting any roi."

2596,"January 23, 2006 11:57AM",british_rover,"ehhh in general i would not advise owning an older land rover out of warranty cause the repairs are just incredibly high if they do break down. that being said they are unique and if you don't drive it a lot and/or don't mind paying the cost they are neat vehicles. on the mark ii or p38 range rovers built from 1995-2002 the air suspension is the big thing that will fail and it is expensive. best just to replace it with a coil conversion kit if you plan to actually use the car and give up on the air bags. the conversion kits are normaly in the 3000 dollar range to install.

don't own a discovery that is not a series ii so no 1999 and under ones and the best discos are the last two years so 2003 and 2004.

freelanders are funny cars but there is nothing else in their size range that is as capable off road. the trannys are weak in them for all years though just not strong enough for the weight of the vehicle.

2003 and 2004 range rovers have a front diff failiure problem that has been corrected now in 2006. 2005 models are different from the 2003 and 2004 editions but none of them have enough mileage to see if they actually fixed the problem yet. the 2006 front diff is totaly different so none will have issues.

the new lr3 and sport are fabulous cars and besides the normal first model year teething trobles no known issues yet."

iirc, jeep was using the name on both vehicles around that time. i couldn't care less about the little one, but i think those big old amc-powered ones (i think they were using 360's by this time) were cool. i think they do have a bit of a cult following."

problem with 1946 cars is that they are actually 1941 cars hauled out after world war ii...and the problem with 1941 cars is that technically they are basically 1934 cars...so you are really dealing with a fairly primitive piece of machinery here...and this continued through 1948...american cars started getting modern around 1949, and took a great leap forward in 1955...then staggered into addiction and rehab in 1958, emerging clean, sober and healthy around 1963. :p"

still, i guess it could keep up with modern traffic. i had a buddy who had a 1950 desoto custom that had 112 hp from a 236 or so inline-6. flathead, too. it wasn't much from, say, 0-60, but it actually didn't have much trouble merging onto a highway, and had no trouble cruising 65-75 even on the hills. basically, it wouldn't hold up traffic unless you had people trying to drag race! i'm guessing they were geared much better back then to take advantage of what little power there was, though. probably adequate around town and at moderate highway cruising, but probably a very low top speed?"

for me, that $100 wagoneer would be (if in relatively decent mechanical condition outside of the engine - could care less about body)a stripper 4x4 to take out hunting or playing. $2000 could put it out and about if it had good axles, transfer case, brakes, etc.

2618,"January 27, 2006 8:21AM",andre1969,"might not be too troublesome. i'm not positive, but i don't think trucks got catalytic convertors until a few years after 1975. and for some reason, amc in general was able to get a delay on putting convertors on their cars. i remember my friends' '76-77 hornet station wagon didn't have a convertor, and came from the factory that way. one time the guy at the emissions station gave them static for it, and they had to get documentation from amc, which thankfully was still around at the time! i dunno if chrysler would've been able to help them out if it was after the takeover.

and with a 401 it might be pretty gutsy. i recall my uncle's '76 jeep pickup wasn't bad, even with just the 360.

as for that house in the background of the other, typical mcmansion, i'm guessing. probably thrown up quick and on the cheap, and the foundation will crack, those columns will pull away, vinyl siding will trap moisture, etc, and it'll end up with mold damage! :surprise:

back in the 60's, levitt and sons (the company who pretty much invented the cookie cutter subdivision) built a community near here, and one model was called the ""manor house"" or something like that. it was really just a 4-bedroom 2.5 bath colonial with a big roof overhang, and columns across the front. the columns didn't actually support the roof overhang, though. it was common for the columns to sink into the ground, pulling loose from the roof!

for some reason, they never could really fix the problem, at least not cheaply, so very few of that style home were actually built."
2619,"January 27, 2006 8:39AM",martian,"as ""the man"" you know quite a bit about the market for restoration cars. again, i pose to you the infamous ""edsel"". if you wander over to www.edsel.com
you learn a lot of interesting facts..like fewer than 6000 of these cars are known to exist. granted, there is nothing terribly attractive about these cars (once decribed as an ""oldsmobile pushing a toilet""), but surely they are of historic interest. suppose you bought and restored on..and kept it in a garage for the next 25 years-would it be worth anything at that point? i can well imagine that most of those poorly restored 6000-odd edsels will be reduced to rust and scrap by that point-so can i make big bucks by restoring one of these monsters?"
2620,"January 27, 2006 8:53AM",andre1969,"ford built something like 110,000 edsels total for '58-60. iirc, around 63k were built in '58, 45k in '59, and 3k in '60.

i'd imagine that if 6,000 are still around, which makes for a survival rate of something like 5.5%, that's actually a lot of cars, as far as these things go.

i think it's the '58's that are considered the most desireable, because they were the most far-out, with more grotesque styling, that speed racer pushbutton in the middle of the steering wheel for the tranny gears, and monstrous 361 and 410 cid v-8's. consumer reports tested a '58 edsel, but i forget the series. from 0-60, it was the fastest car they had ever tested, up to that point.

the '59's were really toned down, in looks, size, and peformance. and the '60 is almost respectable looking, coming off seeming like a copy of a '59 pontiac.

i'd also imagine that most of the edsels these days that are worth saving are being garaged, preserved, and treasured by their owners. they're not being driven as just old used cars, being run into the ground. now i'm sure there are plenty that are in marginal condition right now, just sitting around, that will ultimately be scrapped.

but imo you'd probaby be best off just finding a nice one and holding onto it, than trying to restore one that needs a lot of work. if you're trying to do this for an investment though, you'd really be better off putting the money in i-bonds, or a money market account with emigrant bank or something. most people don't make a big killing fooling around with old cars."

don't '58 oldsmobiles and buicks have a bit of cult following, simply because they're so over-the-top?"

prices for these cars would compare to a desoto adventurer--that's also a slim market car. but you're right, a '58 chevy convertible would bring another 35% easy and a '58 300d even more. they are in a different class than the desoto, at least in collector's eyes. a 300d can push $90,000....you'll not see such prices for a desoto i don't think."

2636,"January 30, 2006 9:05AM",qbrozen,"even if they didn't screw up the paintjob, a rubber-bumper mg ain't worth $8200. i've seen really nice chrome bumper cars for way less."
2637,"January 30, 2006 9:05AM",fintail,"ooops, here's the 'golden anniversary' pontiac

on the mgb indeed...it looks fine for now...but either take them off or find an earlier car."
2638,"January 30, 2006 9:09AM",stickguy,"i wouldn't buy one in any case, but if i was in the market, i would certainly get an older one and upgrade it, rather than a crappy later one that i had to retrofit."
2639,"January 30, 2006 9:11AM",stickguy,"i like it, might take a flyer for that money, depending on the nature of the slight rust.

i am a sucker for a stick shift.

also makes me think of jim rockford when i see one of these. i liked that show, but maybe it was for the cars."
2640,"January 30, 2006 9:13AM",qbrozen,"its funny (i can't remember if i've posted this before), but the guy i paid to paint my alfa also painted all the rubber on the car (using his artistic license without my consent). thankfully, my car is black, so its not a terrible atrocity that he did it ... and it all really needed replacing anyway. so i can sort of forgive what was done to this mgb, as it may not have been the owner's fault. too bad its so painfully obvious on a white car, though."
2641,"January 30, 2006 9:46AM",british_rover,i like that very cool and kind fo unimogish.
2642,"January 30, 2006 11:13AM",Mr_Shiftright,"you're right, '76 mgbs are god-awful cars. you can make a good car out of them but it wouldn't be cheap. they have neither good handling, decent acceleration or much reliability or any good looks left---all the good parts of the earlier bs were just left out completely.

value of that tarted up puppy? at very best, $5,500."

2644,"January 30, 2006 12:57PM",stickguy,"yup, i like my used cars ""some assemply required""

if you are going to get that deep in a project like this, you need to bite the bullet, get the harness (i assume the wiring harness is different?) and whatever else it needs to get running, and at least put the dash back together.

still think it would have been cheaper to just buy a decent si, or do some engine upgrades on the standard civic, but that's just me.

can't see how this bastardized mess is going to be worth what it cost to do, unless it was all a backyard project, you had a base civic with a sick engine, and found a wrecked si for cheap.

and beer. lots of beer."
2645,"January 30, 2006 2:23PM",british_rover,"why would you take a 91 civic and then swap in a 91 crx si motor i mean unless you got the crx motor for free that is dumb. for about the same amount of trouble you could have swapped in any number of newer much better motors from later civics.

for a lot more money, time and trouble you could have made it a real beast and put in a jdm h22."
2646,"January 30, 2006 5:13PM",ghulet,"http://chicago.craigslist.org/car/129876605.html

the price, on its face, sounds fair enough, but then again, i'm always leary of someone claiming an otherwise decent/great car might need 'this or that', but not having been able to figure out the exact problem. i mean, old ls400s aren't exotics, so this could be scary. oh, what was the last time you saw an ls400 with a cloth interior?"
2647,"January 30, 2006 5:28PM",fintail,"iirc some of the very very first ls cars had cloth.

there has to be something else wrong with it, if the owner is unwilling or unable to fix the smallish sounding problem he lists. if thats the only problem, that rig could be worth it for a backyard mechanic to fix for personal use maybe."

2649,"January 30, 2006 6:46PM",xwesx,"well, those electrical bugs can be hell to find, but i'd buy it if i could pop the hood and start the engine by jumping the starter. otherwise, the problem runs deeper than the owner says and definitely more trouble than it is worth. would $1500 be worth it for a decent parts car?"
2650,"January 30, 2006 6:49PM",Mr_Shiftright,"if you can't hear it run you got nothing there but a parts car that nobody wants parts for. also first year ls400s are kinda edgy with power steering rack issues, interiors that aren't very sturdy, etc.

so i'd say bring a mechanic and if you can't get it to run, don't buy it."
2651,"January 30, 2006 6:58PM",fintail,"yeah you'd want to start it. if the engine is shot, it's worthless. i just checked the value right here on edmunds, and retail for that car even with 80k on it in my area was $5200. not a lot of money for one with no issues.

i would say half that money for a parts car.

funny thing about the backseat pic too. that seems to be a classic craigslist ploy. the front probably looks like the scene of a hells angels initiation ceremony. but it still might be better than the leather on those early cars, it really fell apart over time in ones that weren't cared for. i once saw an early ls where the steering wheel was peeling, too. yuck. i'll take a 6cyl w126 from the same year."

this doesn't look too awful

frankenbenz"
2653,"January 30, 2006 7:59PM",ghulet,"....i always find it hard to believe when people want to 'give away' decent cars with problems they invariably claim are minor and/or inexpensive to repair, yet they can't be bothered repairing them. coincidentally, these cars usually aren't drivable, so short of towing them to a mechanic, it's virtually impossible to know what else is going on. chances are, if the owner doesn't have the resources to fix it now, he hasn't kept up on other maintenance, either, so on something like a 15 year-old lexus, there could be a myriad of problems. or maybe he just wants to cut his losses, or wants a new car. this one could pay off, but at least as likely you'd have a $1500 two-ton decoration instead."
2654,"January 30, 2006 8:04PM",ghulet,"...would that 230ce have the same engine as a u.s.-spec 190e 2.3? if so, that car could be a good deal, it looks nice for the price. i just wouldn't want a car that old with a euro-spec engine, not that i'd necessarily want any 25 year-old, 3500 pound car with a 120hp four. then again, i've had worse.

gotta love 1983 cars, the height of anemia--loaded caprice, even has a sport suspension, but a v6 that probably puts out 100hp.

that 280c with the 350 seems about $2k overpriced, imo. i mean, couldn't i find a 300ce or maybe even a 400e for $5-6k?"
2655,"January 30, 2006 9:59PM",fintail,"as far as i know that 2.3 is very similar, yes. i don't know a ton about the 4 cyl engines, but it should be very similar if not the same. it'd be a slug, but there's no fast w123 any way you look at it.

the frankenbenz is overpriced unless you want a curiosity. i've seen some nice looking earlier 300ces bringing that much, and the w124 coupe is just a prettier more modern car. you could get a turbo diesel for that too. that price might be the low end for a decent 400e, or maybe right for an iffier example."
2656,"January 30, 2006 10:02PM",fintail,"really dull and stodgy but some people like this kind of thing. my dad would want it.

nice enough looking w116 for the money"
2657,"January 30, 2006 10:20PM",ghulet,"that 280se looks decent enough, especially for $750, but my those 116s are getting scarce, and i'm afraid they've become high on the 'least loved' list for benzes. i mean, they were a huge step forward technologically in many ways compared to their predecessors, but had their share of problems (thirstiness, bad seat padding off the top of my head), and of course were, um, aesthetically challenged compared to generations before and after."

still, the price is right, eh?"
2660,"January 31, 2006 6:47AM",lemko,holy smoke! that seville is beautiful! i very much doubt he will get that much for it unless somebody really really wants it.
2661,"January 31, 2006 7:25AM",andre1969,"is a very common ploy, simply because it's not that hard to keep a back seat looking good. heck, even on my '79 newport, which had 230,000 miles on it when i bought it from the junkyard, the back seat looked like it was brand-new. and on my '76 lemans and '79 nyer, the back seats look much better than the fronts. now that i think of it, the back seat on my '68 dart, when i bought it with 253,000 miles on it, looked good. the only problem was that it was white vinyl, so it did look a bit dirty. the front was all ripped to hell, though.

with the nyer and lemans i bought from ebay though, they did at least show pics of the front seats as well, so i knew what i was getting myself into!"
2662,"January 31, 2006 7:30AM",andre1969,"but i'm still of the attitude that a halfway decent runner shouldn't be more than $2500 or so. so maybe $7-8k for the nicest one in the world?

i don't think those first-gen sevilles have that much of a following today, because they're just not flashy or hedonistic or massive enough. it's kind of sad, but the very qualities that made them quite capable back when they were new now work against them today. something like this '77 seville almost seems anti-climatic compared to a diamond jubilee mark v, an eldo convertible, fleetwood talisman, or some fluffed up designer edition continental town sedan loveboat."
2663,"January 31, 2006 9:42AM",imidazol97,"i don't think i've ever seen one at a local, annual classic show. good point.

i've seen the gangster back one. maybe they're all being driven by original owners who don't yet see them as interesting cars."
2664,"January 31, 2006 10:02AM",andre1969,"pretty regularly at shows like spring/fall carlisle, when they have the big swap meet. can't remember if i've seen many at the gm nationals though. and maybe one or two might pop up at the big classic car show in macungie, pa.

i like 'em, though. while i do have a thing for those big, hedonistic monsters, i can also appreciate a slim, trim (for the time) mini-cruiser like a first-gen seville. don't get me started on the lincoln versailles, though! :p"
2665,"January 31, 2006 10:46AM",fintail,"yeah, the w116 wasn't a beauty, especially in us-spec. look at the size of those bumpers, and the ugly lights. they also had interiors that decompose, that engine is kind of clattery (not far removed from the unit in my fintail), and they do rust. still...it's pocket money.

that seville is at least 100% overpriced i am sure, but it is nice looking.

that fintail is way beyond redemption, but i think its worth it as a parts car. i see it has dealer-installed ac and a period radio...those two alone are worth the money. i am sure it has some other odd trim that could be useful too, maybe glass and lenses as well. that's the kind of thing i would buy if i had a place to keep old heaps. i could accumulate 50 of them and start my own fintail u-pull junkyard.

speaking of the seneca from the mystery car pix thread

this looks to be in remarkable condition...of course it also has zero fun quotient and the same value quotient"
2666,"January 31, 2006 10:53AM",lemko,"there are plenty of really nice first-gen sevilles at the cadillac shows i attend. some of these cars are in such excellent condition, i swear the owners bought them right off the lot and had them hermetically sealed in special storage after they got them home. there are also quite a few of the odd bustleback 1980-85 sevilles in equally good condition. i see virtually none of the awful 1986-91 generation."
2667,"January 31, 2006 11:09AM",british_rover,might make a good rolling billboards for events or something if you could ever get parts for it that is.
2668,"January 31, 2006 11:10AM",jrosasmc,"there's an older lady in my town who has one of the ""awful"" sevilles, a '91 that she bought new. it only has 46k miles on it and she does not take it out in rain or snow. she has told me on more than one occasion that it will someday be a ""collector's car."" the question is: why bother?"
2669,"January 31, 2006 11:22AM",andre1969,"what some people start thinking will be ""collector cars"". there's this old lady who works on my floor, and has an ion that she hates. she mentioned another lady she knows who has a ""classic car"" (her words, not mine) that she'd love to buy off of her. her rationale is that she could buy this ""classic car"", put the money in it to fix it up, and would have a much better car than her ion.

well, she mentioned that it's always parked out back and immediately i said ""oh, that old brown nova?!"" this was one of those old late 70's nova sedans that had the 6 taillights instead of the usual 4, and while it still had round headlights, it had a pretentious vertical grille, and an interior with a bit more fluff. it was called either a nova concours or luxury nova, i forget which.

anyway, i've worked here for 13 years now, and used to see the car all the time back then, and truth be told, it didn't look so hot back then! i can't imagine what condition it's in now! i usually don't park out in back, but i do still see it on occasion, off in the distance at the back of the parking lot during the times that i do. i guess if nothing else, it still runs. either that or it broke down in that spot years ago, and security just hasn't bothered with it!

it just tickled me though, that someone thought that a tired old late 70's nova would be a better car than her fairly-new saturn. geeze, i hope more people don't start thinking like that, or gm is doomed! she asked me what i thought it was worth, and i said oh, maybe $500-1000. of course, she didn't believe me, because it was a ""classic"".

funny how people think that just because a car has survived long enough to get historic tags that suddenly it's a hot commodity."
2670,"January 31, 2006 11:30AM",ghulet,"...my mom is the opposite (not that she's quite an 'old lady' yet), but cars that i think are classics (66 cadillacs, 67 chevies) were out when she was in high school, so they're just 'old cars' to her. i guess some day someone will think a corsica is a classic, but hopefully not too soon. i have a hard time thinking of any nova as a 'classic', mostly because they were generally unloved orphans when new. a mid-70s concours sedan? no way."
2671,"January 31, 2006 11:38AM",fintail,"it's funny...on that note, there are older cars i don't think of as ""classic"" like 70s land yachts, that many of my friends do think of as ""classic"". cars that i can remember as just very out of style looking old used cars from when i was a little kid can't be ""classic"". i can call some early and mid 60s cars ""classic"", but the bloat of the late 60s hurts the idea to me.

but at the same time, i have a heirarchy...there's ""classic"" and ""special interest"". even some 80s cars are ""special interest"" to me. those land yachts would fit in there.

of course, we could always go by a haughty out of touch aaca ""classic"" definition, and very few postwar cars would fit the definition."
2672,"January 31, 2006 11:44AM",andre1969,"i tend to cut things off around 1970. where if it's a 1969 or older it's ""classic"" (my definition, not the aaca's!) but if it's 1970 or newer, it's just an old car....even though there are plenty of examples of ""just old cars"" that i love and cherish! :shades:

i think the main reason i probably do that is that i was born in 1970, and i remember most of the 70's, whereas the 60's were before my time and as a result just seemed more exotic, i guess.

also, for the most part, anything domestic designed in the 70's was often inferior to the 60's car it replaced, so that might reinforce my attitude a bit. for example, the big '71-76 gm cars didn't hold up as well as the '70 and earlier. same with the '73-77 intermediates versus the '68-72. and usually 70's cars didn't perform as well as their 60's counterparts, although to be fair, something like a '78 impala with a 305 would do about as well in acceleration is a '68 impala with a 307."
2673,"January 31, 2006 11:45AM",1racefan,"have a custom platform/deck built on the roof of it, park it by a nascar track on race weekend, and i guarantee it would go quickly and show up in the infield of a racetrack in the future."
2674,"January 31, 2006 12:00PM",fintail,"i am similar in that, i guess. i was born 7 years after you, but i grew up in the inland northwest - a very dry area. so there was a lot of 50s and 60s metal still on the road when i was a kid in the 80s. i remember some older cars on my street - a 66 or so pontiac 4 door ht driven by a teenager. i remember he replaced the cool original steering wheel with a chain link one (!). i thought that seemed dangerous. there was also an old man with a 54 or so hudson hollywood coupe, there was a 65 mustang, and a couple blocks away a guy had 3 59 fords, all in nice condition. the hudson seemed old because my dad liked it, but the others were nothing more than curiosities. our neighbors had a fiat x19 as a toy car, and it seemed like a modern normal car to me. the same people also had a very nice 46 chevy pickup that seemed old, but not especially antique at the time. their normal car was a camry - boring even then.

near a friend's house there was a guy with a 49 mercury wagon in his backyard. he had mean looking dogs so i never got to see it very close, but i had an interest in it as it looked like a surfer car (funny as i lived in the desert). right near that there was an old couple with a pristine swb 300se fintail, two tone grey and white. i thought it was very ugly and couldn't understand how mb could make something so weird. sometimes it would be parked on the street and i would examine it, and it was just too weird for me, especially the dashboard. how things change.

a friend of my dad's had a place on the egde of town, with about 30 cars in his backyard. some of them i thought were cool, like a model a, ford anglia 105e, and some 50s metal...but most of it was 60s stuff that didn't really get me going. i remember he had a roadrunner back there, along with several 65-66 impala 2 doors. he's probably made a little money now.

i guess a lot of the ""classic car"" thing is relative. i'll have a hard time calling most anything from the 80s classic."
2675,"January 31, 2006 12:03PM",british_rover,yeah that is another good idea.
2676,"January 31, 2006 12:21PM",andre1969,"about the ""classic car"" thing being relative was when one of the kids that worked inside at the pizza place i delivered for said about my '79 newport ""wow, it's older than i am!"" so i guess to her, a 1979 car would seem just as old and from a different era as a 1969 does to me.

another sign was, a few years later, oh, around 2000, i was talking about my dart (hadn't used it to deliver pizzas in about 3 years by this time) and one of the kids working there asked ""what's a dart?"" :confuse:"
2677,"January 31, 2006 12:37PM",martian,"i think you are right about the decade of the 40's-wwii put the industry on hold from 1941-45-i recall that the giant ford rouge plant made bombers for the aaf! the decade of the 30's was a tough one-with the onset of the great depression, nobody had any money, and some great marques bit the dust. so your observation about the lack of progress in the 30's is correct. about the only bright spot was ford's hi power v-8s (beloved of bonny and clyde), and the final adoption of hydraulic brakes. one other thing-detroit didn't make driving easy for a long time-the power sterring system used today was patented in 1927-but didn't appear on oldsmobile cars until 1954! :confuse:"
2678,"January 31, 2006 2:03PM",lemko,"well, some uninformed people think my 1989 cadillac brougham is a classic. i know the car will be nothing of the sort. in the future, i will probably be like the old guy who really liked his 1958 buick limited sedan in his youth and preserved it as well as he could."
2679,"January 31, 2006 2:06PM",andre1969,"one of the kids my one roommate works with, who just turned 21 i think, really ooh'ed and ahh'ed when he first saw my '76 lemans. he's like ""wow, a musclecar!!"" i just kinda kept my mouth shut on that one.

but i'm pretty much the same as you, lemko. i like what i like, and don't really care if it becomes a highly-valued collectible or not."
2680,"January 31, 2006 3:02PM",fintail,"that's a way to look at it...when i got my fintail in 1994, it was 30 years old. today a 30 year old car is from 1976, and a car as old as the fintail is now would have been from 1952, back in 1994. it's all relative.

the best thing to do is like what you like, and keep it. few cars are wise financial decisions anyway, so you might as well have some fun."
2681,"January 31, 2006 7:34PM",lilengineerboy,"that is a parts car to fix up a urquattro. the doors, hood, trunk and interior will mate on to the urq. shiftright is correct, its a major pita to work on, might as well be something cool.
the coupegts are running about $500 on ebay.
i think the minimum to have a cool audi is for it to at least be awd like a 91 200 quattro with the 20 valve engine. its about as powerful and as fast as a wrx but about half again as big, and 10 years older."
2682,"February 1, 2006 6:51AM",andre1969,"i was stuck behind an early 80's, knight rider/smokey and the bandit iii style trans am at a traffic light. it had pennsylvania plates on it, and they were historic! i thought it was a bit odd, because the oldest that car could be is a 1982, and in maryland it wouldn't be eligible for historic plates until january 1, 2007, which is when they consider it to be 25 years old. maybe in pa it's only 20 years?

still, it seemed really strange to think that something like that will be showing up soon at aaca meetings. in the words of buford t. justice, ""what in the hell's the world coming to?""

guess i shouldn't talk though, since my '79 nyer and '76 lemans would now qualify for aaca meets!"
2683,"February 1, 2006 7:03AM",lemko,seen stranger things. remember the 1979 amc concord that was at macungie?
2684,"February 1, 2006 8:03AM",andre1969,"yeah, i remember that one! actually, i was thinking about bringing either my '79 nyer or '76 lemans to macungie this year, so that we could park on the field and not have to walk so far! plus, that way i could keep a cooler in it with some drinks and stuff, which would help out if it's a hot day.

i know you'd probably prefer to see the nyer, but the lemans really does show better. it's in better shape, has correct wheels (if not tires), doesn't have its exhaust dragging. plus, its radio works. the nyer lost its fm band about a year ago for some reason, and then on the way to the mopar carlisle show this past summer, the antenna broke off! oh well, not like i was missing much anyway...the only thing i could find when it snapped off was dr. phil. :p

2690,"February 1, 2006 1:32PM",andre1969,those 80's jags are such money pits. i've always loved the styling of 'em.

2692,"February 1, 2006 1:44PM",andre1969,"there was this family that went to my church who drove exclusively jags. this was around 1992 i guess. one of them was a pale lilac/rose metallic and the other was black. i knew one was an '83 and one was an '86, but didn't know which was which. i thought the black one was the newer one because it looked nicer...turns out it had been repainted! the lilac/rose one was horribly faded. also found out that they paid something like $4,000 for the '86.

i thought that was a killer deal at the time for a recent jag. heck, that's probably about what my mom's '86 monte carlo would have gone for at the time. but thinking back on it, mom's '86 monte carlo cost around $14k new. i'm sure that the jag cost a few bucks more! someone took a bath, at trade in time, i'm sure. :sick:"

this guy is in the a-body club i belong to, a site devoted to the '73-77 lemans specifically (see, look around on the 'net enough and you'll find a club devoted to anything! i think we get more traffic than the buick apollo club though :p ), and its gm siblings in general. i kinda like it, although i'm not so crazy about the color. and i can't stand those fender skirts. they look especially clashy with the rally 2 wheels.

also kinda interesting that for being a ""luxury lemans"", which was later renamed ""grand lemans"", the interior seems pretty basic. my '76 has a much more plush, luxurious interior. but then, by '76 sales were really falling off, so maybe they were fluffing them up in an attempt to make them more appealing? i think the '76 only sold around 96k units, versus maybe 250k of the '73."

but somehow, in the meantime, he was able to score a used integra 2-door. forget the year, but it was the kind with the little quad bug-eyed headlights. i'm guessing a '94? now you'd think something like that would be kinda expensive, but i think it was ragged out and had really high miles."

if it had any other engine, even a 305 or 301, i'd actually consider it for maybe $1000, if it was closer. normally i don't like brown cars, but for some reason i always thought pontiac pulled them off pretty well."

2735,"February 3, 2006 11:18AM",Mr_Shiftright,"you must live in a low-labor rate area. dropping the rear end and doing rotors calipers and pads (you really don't want to ""patch up"" an xj6 brake job once you've disemboweled the back half of the car) usually runs $1,500 or better.

and once your saddle (two) gas tanks rust out (and they will), you'll do it all over again....unless those rear suspension needle bearings (same as the e-type) go out, then you can saw the entire car in half and do everything at the same time. :p"
2736,"February 3, 2006 11:23AM",qbrozen,"well, in the case of the volvo, both the dealer and midas insist there is no ""turning the oem rotors"" because that would put them out of safe specs. so, in my quote, that included replacing the rotors (which many s70 owners find they need to do every 30k miles, if using oem stuff)."
2737,"February 3, 2006 11:29AM",qbrozen,"that's just jags for you, in general, i presume.

when i was shopping for my latest purchase, i narrowed it down to a used lincoln ls or used s-type. usually, when i narrow the list this far, i research parts/repairs cost. i looked up one repair for the s-type, and it made up my mind for me. turns out a set of new shocks would run me $1800 (that's for the ""adaptive"" suspension, by the way). as much as i loved the feel of the jag, i just couldn't wrap my brain (and wallet) around repairs like that."
2738,"February 3, 2006 11:35AM",xwesx,replacing oem rotors every 30k? ouch! i am still on original oems at 200k for my subaru. 30k replacement... sounds like a mfg defect to me.
2739,"February 3, 2006 11:41AM",andre1969,"that makes me think of my '85 silverado, which has those infamous saddle tanks that can be quite dangerous if you get t-boned at 73 mph. and especially if you have an igniter rigged up like they did on dateline! :p

anyway, i had one of them go bad last may...started leaking fuel in the yard. i ended up just parking it and letting it all drain out, and used it in lawnmowers and such. well, then tank #2 decided to bite the bullet and leak a couple months later! i got an estimate from the repair shop, and it came in at damn near $900, per tank!! :surprise:

well, i wasn't ready to blow that much money, so i just had one tank done. total cost to replace the driver's side tank, plus the brackets, bypass the crossover switch, and disconnect the passenger-side tank (and screw the door shut so nobody would ever accidentally put gas in it) came to around $885.

aren't the tanks on the jag actually inside the trunk? seems to me they should be relatively safe from rust. with my truck, the mechanic told me that basically, water gets up between the top of the tank and and bottom of the bed and stays there, and starts it to rusting. then as it deteriorates, i guess crap starts to accumulate at the bottom of the tank, and make it rust as well.

how much would it cost to do the gas tanks on a jag? and could you just get away with doing one of them, like i did on my truck?"
2740,"February 3, 2006 11:44AM",qbrozen,"eh, just a compromise i believe they made to get decent bite with little noise or something. in other words, soft metal.

not a big deal. i took the opportunity to replace with better aftermarket stuff for less money."
2741,"February 3, 2006 11:44AM",andre1969,"i ended up warping the front rotors on my '00 intrepid, and replaced them around 97,000 miles. simple enough though that i was able to do it myself, for a total cost of around $83, including new front pads. guess i did it right, because it's about 16,000 miles later and nothing fell off yet! :p

i had the rear brakes done around the 101,000 mile mark (second time they were done...first time was around 51,000), and they were able to just turn the rotors. i think a lot of domestic rotors are so cheap though, that sometimes it's easier to just replace them with new ones. i dunno...the back ones might be pricier."
2742,"February 3, 2006 11:46AM",andre1969,"something like 99.6% of all 1955 desotos were equipped with an automatic transmission. here's one that wasn't.

they sit on the same platform same, motor, same everything minus some styling and suspension stuff like you mentioned.

as for the oem rotors being replaced at 30k that is just a european thing all european cars get the rotors replaced when the pads go. like our rovers a front brake job on a range rover will cost 1000-1200 dollars and you will have to do it at around 30k if not a little sooner with heavy braking."
2746,"February 3, 2006 12:04PM",qbrozen,"yes, i do know that. one of the big differences being the shocks on my ls don't cost $1800 to replace.

there is something to be said for ""keeping it simple.""

and, actually, their are alot of differences between the cars. and what they do share is covered up beyond recognition. you'll find 2 very different cars when you drive them back-to-back (as i did on a couple of occassions when deciding). kind of like the accord vs tl (although i found those to be much more similar than the stype vs ls)."

2752,"February 3, 2006 1:03PM",andre1969,"but i think there was one year in there, like 1982, when gm eliminated all 5-liter engines from their midsized cars. so that would mean that you were limited to the likes of the buick 252 v-6 (125 hp and even more prone to self-destruction than the 231), chevy 267 (~120-125 hp, and really no worse than any other smallblock chevy), olds 260 (100 hp, and about as bulletproof as it gets, but gawd, that 100 hp is embarrassing!) and pontiac 265 (~120 hp, and derived from the troubleprone 301, but not really strong enough to hurt itself, so considerably more reliable)

i think 1983 was the year they got rid of all those little sub-5 liter v-8's, and you could get a 305 in a chevy/pontiac, and a 307 in the olds, but buick wanted you to go turbo for your extra power."

2765,"February 5, 2006 11:21AM",andre1969,"i don't think the olds 260 ever found its way into many, if any buicks. especially not by 1982-83. i was just listing all the undersized engines that gm used around that timeframe in their various midsizes. now in a big olds or buick, you could get a 307 v-8. and in a caprice/impala you could get a 305. there were no big pontiacs in '82.

a buddy of mine had an '82 cutlass supreme sedan with the 260, and honestly, for having 100 hp it did better than i though it would. i had a 1986 monte carlo for a few months, with a 305-4bbl, 150 hp, 245 ft-lb of torque (iirc) and a 4-speed automatic tranny. for having 50 less hp, that cutlass didn't seem any worse in normal driving, and even in hard-out acceleration, kept up surprisingly well with my monte.

now in something like 0-60 it would be no contest. i'd imagine my monte would do it in around 10 seconds, while if i were to take a wild guess, 14 or so for the cutlass? but at highway speeds it seemed to have good passing power.

ultimately, he got like $600 in trade for it in 1999 when he bought a '95 grand marquis. it had at least 150,000 miles on it. interestingly, $600 is all he got in 2004 when he traded that grand marquis for an '04 crown vic! it was up to around 175,000 though!

as for the thm350, sometimes you'd get lucky i guess. my '82 cutlass supreme, which just had a 231 v-6, had a thm 350. but i had to get it rebuilt, so i guess i wasn't that lucky! :blush:"

2767,"February 6, 2006 9:55AM",andre1969,"almost looks artistic, sitting out in the field like that. the seller got the year wrong. it's either a '51 or '52. the '53 had a 1-piece windshield, bolder, sleeker, chromier grille, and a more modern looking roofline with a reverse-slant c-pillar and wraparound rear window.

odd that wraparound rear windows started becoming pretty common, but it would still be a bit before the wraparound windshield came into vogue."

that pontiac phoenix looks like it's in nice shape. i never really cared for those, though. that body style looked really nice, clean, and modern as the nova, but those padded landau roofs just didn't work. and that pontiac front-end just doesn't seem to fit quite right.

those two oldsmobiles are really nice. i always thought those f-85's were cute little things."
2803,"February 7, 2006 9:32AM",bumpy,"is that old ford truck one of those extra-long bed models? iirc they offered a 9-foot bed in some years.

i dunno, i think it's just a regular 8-footer. gm offered a 9-foot fenderside bed for a while, and there was the longhorn option for a year or three around 1970. i seem to remember that the ford 9-foot bed was an option for the extended-cab '70s trucks.

edit: the pontiac is a ventura."
2804,"February 7, 2006 9:41AM",andre1969,"my goof...i forgot that the phoenix didn't come out until something like mid-year 1977. they almost looked worse, imo, because it looked like they forced a 1978 lemans front-end onto the ventura, and it just didn't look right.

i see an old skylark of that vintage here at work sometimes. i think they look pretty nice, for a nova clone. the 4-doors of this style were pretty shapely imo, and the 2-door really looked good...as long as you didn't get the landau roof with those clumsy opera windows!"
2805,"February 7, 2006 10:44AM",michaellno,"hey now, i owned one of those in college. i think mine was a '77 olds omega, however. 350 v8 - well, only 7 of the 8 cylinders really worked, i found out later.

it had been repainted bright blue with the white landau roof and faux wire wheels. i bought it when my '79 sunbird was totalled with about 4 months left to graduation.

paid $1000 for it and sold it on the day i graduated to some bhph lot for something like $150 -- 85% depreciation in 4 months has to be some sort of record."
2806,"February 7, 2006 10:50AM",fintail,decent driver for the money
2807,"February 7, 2006 11:06AM",andre1969,"now that i think back on it, i remember a '77 or so olds omega for sale locally at a park-and-sell lot. it was light blue, and it must've been a brougham model or something, because the interior was pretty high-class. most of it was covered in a soft, felt material that was comfy, but didn't look like it would be too durable. however, this one was nicely preserved.

this one was a sedan, though. and it only had the 100 or so hp olds 260 v-8. sounded nice, with that distinctive oldsmobile rumble, but just didn't have any bite to back up its bark.

supposedly those '75-79 x-bodies were among the best handling domestic compacts of the time."
2808,"February 7, 2006 12:10PM",michaellno,"i don't remember the trim level of my omega, but the seat description sounds familiar.

i remember that i had to buy tires for it, and since i was a starving college student, i cheaped out and bought something that escapes me ... either bias-ply (were they available in 1985?) or i bought only two tires and they didn't match the other two ... either way, i remember driving it on i-17 in phoenix and having the car feel really squirrelly. like the back end was going to break loose on me when i changed lanes.

i couldn't get rid of that car fast enough. after selling it and graduating, i moved back to california and bought a year old accord with 17k on it for $8500 .. my other options were a new grand am or a new mustang. glad i passed on those!"
2809,"February 7, 2006 12:18PM",imidazol97,"radials on the front and bias ply on rear would do that. the radials stick and are forgiving to side forces while the bias plys reacted.

i had bias snow tires on rear with radials on front during snow periods. that was real touch and go."
2810,"February 7, 2006 12:24PM",andre1969,"my experience with bias-ply tires is limited. my '57 desoto has them, and my '69 dart gt had them when i bought it, but i soon replaced them with modern 205/70/r14 blackwalls. made a night/day difference in the dart's handling.

the late 60's were kind of a transition period where i don't think it mattered so much, but supposedly if you put radial tires on something really old, like my '57 desoto, it would make the handling really squirrely."
2811,"February 7, 2006 12:31PM",stickguy,"looks decent, but who knows what the ""very little rust"" is. i agree, if it is basically sound, not a bad buy at that price. i would grab it myself (i always liked these) if it was a 4 speed. and not on the opposite side of the country."
2812,"February 7, 2006 1:06PM",andre1969,"has this gem for sale, for the low price of $3995. looks almost like my silverado, just a little cheaper (mine has quad headlights and 15x8 rally wheels) and in better looking shape (although it's hard to tell from the pics how rusty the lower part of the cab is). fairly low miles, too, around 64,000.

they also have this beauty, but it's a few bucks more."
2813,"February 7, 2006 1:27PM",bumpy,"i always liked those mid-60s fords; if i hadn't bought the gmc i probably would have bought one of those. you'd better jump on that ford while you can. judging by the crop of clone houses behind the lot, that local place won't be around too much longer."
2814,"February 7, 2006 1:45PM",andre1969,"yeah, those clone houses are growing like weeds around here. in fact, if you look to the left of this pic of my garage, you can see what's sprung up just up the road from me!

i think they want something like $15k for that ford, though, so it won't be coming to my house anytime soon! that dealer's been around since 1946, and supposedly pretty active in the community, so i don't think they're going anywhere anytime soon. they used to sell nashes back in the day. eventually though, i guess they might want to sell out, if land values shoot up enough."
2815,"February 7, 2006 2:04PM",fintail,"that ford is way overpriced. i don't mind those old trucks, but you could get a nice one way cheaper i think."
2816,"February 7, 2006 3:10PM",michaellno,"yep, that sounds about right. i remember being quite scared, since this was in the summer and the afternoon thunderstorms made the roads even more treacherous than normal.

geez, if they want $15k for that old ford and $4k for the '85 chevy, i wonder what my dad's '70 chevy c10 is worth? i know he's turned down an offer of $8500, and this was before the full restore he had done last year."

the ad says it's the high-output 305, but i doubt it. afaik, only the monte ss got the ho 305, which had 180 hp. ss was just a graphics package for the el camino. most likely it just has the normal 150 hp 305-4bbl that went into plain monte carlos, grand prixes, el caminos, and bonneville g's. the big cars and pickups got 165 hp, i guess because the intake and/or exhaust wasn't as restrictive.

nice car/truck, though. i always liked those downsized el caminos.

as for that 1960 lesabre, lose the skirts and it's not a bad looking car. i don't know why he thinks it has a 4.1 v-8, though. they came standard with a 364 v-8 (about a 6-liter) which only had 235 hp. must've been a really de-tuned 2-bbl, because i know mopar got 295 out of their 361 that year with a 2-bbl, and even when it was detuned for '61, still had 265.

maybe it has a 401 under the hood? there was a 401 v-8 that was standard in the invicta and electra...maybe it was optional in the lesabre?"

jaguar xj6: be afraid, be very afraid....

actually you can do all right with an old xj6 if you follow some basic rules and stay sober and remember that you are buying an essentially worthless car that will never be worth more than you paid for it. buy 1985-86 only,(last of the three series, the only xj that wasn't truly awful) extremely well maintained car only only buy a cream puff...no projects, no ""only needs a...."", no rust, pay more $$$ up front for something that passes a 658 point mechanical inspection, otherwise things will happen so fast you won't believe a car can fall apart that fast...

the whole character of an xj6 is the smooth and silky driveline...adding a rude chevrolet v-8 takes that character away (and might twist your car's frame, besides, from all the torque).

even though i have zero mechanical skills (ask my wife .. she'll tell you), i've always thought about restoring some old 60's car just for fun.

i think the dart gt looks like it could be the basis for a nice project. pretty cheap, easy to work on, and not valuable if authentic, so you can pretty much do whatever you want to with it.

i personally would like a 1970ish dart/duster 340 4 speed. i know there was one year that was the best, but i forget which one.

american muscle car did a show on them not too long ago. plus, my 2nd car was a duster, so i still have fond memories of doing stupid things in it (the sunroof came in handy in quite a few ways..) :blush:"

if i was to pick a favorite year for the demon/duster/sport style, i'd go for a '72 demon. just something about the front-end that year looks aggressive, almost evil!"
2880,"February 14, 2006 9:10AM",Mr_Shiftright,"'78 mercury----price is market correct.

dart gt -- it would be fun as long as you don't want to stop or steer at high speed. but with some upgrades, it might be okay. tires, shocks, sway bar, that sort of thing.

i still think any modern 4 cylinder car of decent displacement would easily keep pace with it, though. those old engine/trans powertrains are very inefficient so they gobble up or waste a lot of horsepower."

2883,"February 14, 2006 9:35AM",andre1969,"the dart was good for 0-60 in about 10 seconds with the 180 hp 2-bbl, and 8.2 seconds with the 235 hp 4-bbl version. even consumer reports was able to get 0-60 in around 10 seconds out of a 2-bbl version once. for comparison though, the 225 slant six was good for more like 14 seconds, while the little 170 was probably more like 16-18 seconds, depending on gearing, and whether it was a dart or valiant it was in.

they might be inefficient by today's standards, but for the time were pretty good. one definite advantage the dart/valiant had was that it used a 3-speed automatic. most compacts and even many larger cars were still stuck with archaic 2-speeds which would usually give you a 1-2 punch by hindering both acceleration and fuel economy.

i dunno if a '65 dart gt would have 10"" brakes with the v-8. by the late 60's, i know they put in larger brakes for v-8 models. my '69 dart 225 only had 9"" drums, but my '68 318 has 10"" drums all around. they're pretty good at stopping the car, provided they're adjusted correctly. sure, you get some yahoo who's only used to modern cars behind the wheel, and you can have fun watching them kill themselves, but once you get used to 'em, they're not that bad. heck, i've logged over 100,000 miles between my two darts, and lived to tell about it! :p"
2884,"February 14, 2006 9:44AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah, you have to drive them soberly and they're okay. but in strict engineering terms, the engines vastly overpower the chassis and brakes on many 60s v-8s. they are pretty incompetent, even for 1965, as the europeans put out some very good handling cars in that era.

this is why there is such a brisk aftermarket in retro-rods. modern owners of old cars want good steering and brakes."

drive on over and see me!"
2886,"February 14, 2006 9:53AM",stickguy,"with something like that dart. if you find a clean one (good ""bones"") that is straight and generally rust free, you have a good foundation for mechanical upgrades. disk brake conversion, better suspension, engine tweaks, etc. usually not too expensive, and lot's of bang for the buck.

best thing is, parts tend to be cheap on these, and you can often retrofit better components from other models (or later versions). there isn't that much of a difference between a '65 and '75 dart, is there?

i remember reading once that you could take most of a modern car (a camaro) chassis and stick it right onto a '57 chevy 9suspension/steering/brakes), which sounds plausible."
2887,"February 14, 2006 10:09AM",andre1969,"it's popular to take the sub-frame of a 1970-1981 camaro and use that as the basis for many customizations of older cars. that way you can bolt all the camaro stuff to the older car.

as for darts, you could get disc brakes for them back in the 60's...it was something like a $23.00 option. nobody really cared, though. part of the problem might have been that once you get disc brakes, a power booster is almost mandatory, and i think the power assist is where much of the cost came in.

i think it was 1973 when disc brakes became really common on darts and valiants. it'll swap onto the older drum-brake models, but i think you have to also swap either the upper or lower control arm, as one of them was changed for use with disc brakes. the '73-76 disc brakes also use the larger 4.5"" bolt pattern, which brings the dart in line with the rest of the chrysler lineup of cars. the drum brake darts and the pre-1973 disc brake ones used the smaller 4"" bolt pattern.

i know a guy with a '59 dodge coronet with the d-500 option. he converted it to 4-wheel discs. there's actually a conversion kit you can get for the front that uses aspen/volare brakes. that bothers me a bit, because, i dunno, but i'd rather have drum brakes on a big car that were engineered for a big car, rather than disc brakes that were engineered for a compact! unless it used copcar brakes. my '89 gran fury, which was volare-based, used the same disc brakes as my '79 new yorker.

as for the rear axle, his '59 coronet has an 8 3/4 rear end out of an old challenger/barracuda (the e-body rear axle is within millimeters of the old full-sized mopars) and the disc brakes come from, iirc, a 1979-85 eldorado.

i've thought about getting my '57 desoto's brakes converted, because they're annoying as hell. they actually do a commendable job stopping the car...12-inch ""total contact"" drums will do that for ya! but they're overly complicated. you need a special wheel puller to get to the rear brakes, and the front brakes actually employ two cylinders on each wheel! it makes the shoes apply to the drums more evenly, but it also adds complexity and there's just more to adjust. and i figure hell, the thing needs new brakes anyway, so maybe i'll just take the plunge and go disc!"

2890,"February 14, 2006 11:48AM",martian,"i fyou are serious about restoring an old dodge dart 9and driving it), you really must upgrade the brakes-those old chrysler oem rear drums were terrible=prone to lock-up and fade. and when one wheel locked, you lost a lot of sterring control. of course, those old darts were really just basic transportation cars-mine had rubber flooring mats 9carpet was an option). but the old slant 6 was a very durable engine-many wopuld run over 160k miles with very little problems. the carbs though-another story-due to the crude float design, left hand turns at speed would ofetn cause an engine stall!"
2891,"February 14, 2006 11:52AM",stickguy,"i remember the drums on my '73 duster. one day i ran through a big puddle coming out of a parking lot. soaked the brakes, and they went away completely. blew right through a stop sign, onto a main street (at a t intersection no less). thankfully i made the turn and didn't hit anybody.

didn't buy a car without front disks after that episode!

sad thing was, the family car at the time (which i learned to drive on) was a 1969 volvo 144. fantastic 4 wheel disks (non power too, andre), although they did squeal most of the time. at least we always knew when my parents where almost home."

i've also driven cars without brakes though (don't worry, not for any long length of time...maybe 10 miles, tops) so maybe that's why it doesn't bother me so much.

for a brief period of time, i had a 1967 chrysler newport. 383-2bbl, nothing really fancy, but i'd guess it weighed about 2 tons. it had drum brakes, non-power. before me it belonged to a little old lady. now for me it was no big deal to drive (until the brakes failed on it), but i just can't imagine a fraile little old lady driving a 2-ton car like that with non-power brakes!

oh, i've also run disc-brake cars through big puddles, and had loss of braking power. i remember doing it with my grandma's '85 lesabre. and my 1980 malibu. it's scary enough when you do it in an all-drum car and expect them to fail, but even scarier when you're in a disc car and don't expect them to fail! :surprise:"

2899,"February 14, 2006 2:06PM",andre1969,"yup, that's absolutely right. i think ""frame off"" restoration has really been more of a slang term for ages now, though.

now some mopars did have a sub-frame that was isolated from the structure by these big rubber grommets, so theoretically you could just unbolt it and the suspension, engine, and tranny would drop right out. my '79 nyer is like this, and i'm pretty sure my '89 gran fury was, too. i forget where the torsion bars hook in though...can't remember if it's part of the subframe assembly or some part that's welded to the body structure.

afaik though, the rear sub-frames were always welded in. i'd imagine that the challenger's front sub-frame's welded in, too. it was based on the midsized platform, which didn't go to the isolated sub-frame until 1974-79 (and the '79-81 r-body derivative).

the last body-on-frame mopar car was the 1966 imperial, which used the same platform from 1957. all the other brands went unitized for 1960."

change in in torque-converter/pressure-plate in 68 made before/after engine swaps needed a transmission as well (or a more creatative move).

70 and older models used a smaller bolt pattern with left hand lub nuts on one side."
2904,"February 15, 2006 1:30PM",andre1969,"the dart/valiant went through a redesign in 1967, but i'm not sure how advanced it was, technologically. the '63 really wasn't designed to handle a v-8, although it was modified to get the smallblock 273 wedge shoehorned in for '64. the '67-76, however, was designed to take a smallblock wedge with ease, and even a big-block or hemi. i know from experience that the engine bay of the dart is roomier than the aspen/volare/diplomat/et al that replaced it.

both the '63-66 dart and the '67-76 dart rode a 111"" wheelbase. the valiant was on a 106"" wb from '63-66 though, and went to 108"" for 67-69. from then it got tricky. in 1970, the duster replaced the upright 2-door sedan, and stayed on the 108"" wb with the sedan. dodge got a version of the duster, called the demon, and in exchange the valiant got a version of the hardtop, called the scamp, on a 111"" wheelbase. the 2-door sedan was dropped from the dart lineup after 1968, replaced by a low-line hardtop.

originally, the dart was billed as a ""senior"" compact, a step up from the valiant. this was the way to go in the early 60's, as a tempest/special/f-85 was a step up from a corvair or chevy ii, and a comet was supposed to be a step up from a falcon. by the 70's nobody cared though about a larger, ""step up"" compact, so for 1974 they finally put the valiant sedan on the longer 111"" dart wheelbase.

i don't know if this is true or not, but i've heard some people (mainly fanboys though) say that the '63-66 models were better built than the '67-76 models. seems like some of the nicer versions of the '63-66 models were more colorful than later models, but i dunno about nicer. my '68 dart originally had a 2-tone interior with white vinyl burgundy everything else, which i'm sure was very classy in its day. alas, by the time i got ahold of it, it was 24 years old and had 253,000 miles on it. and, well, you know how white tends to hold up over the years... :sick:"

the nova has to be about the most boring old car imaginable. at least if it was a 2 door, it would be a worthwhile hot rod candidate.

2916,"February 16, 2006 11:29AM",andre1969,"lemko, the ""fifth avenue"" is a fairly solid ""middle-of-the-road"" type of car. fairly stable handling, and keeps relatively good control when the police, rival gang members, etc try to batter you into submission. a little heavy around corners, and a little slow to accelerate, but decent top speed. can also take a decent amount of gunfire before it explodes, too. and relatively hard to flip. now i've heard other people rag on the car, partly because you get forced to do some missions in it (in the game, your older brother has this type of car) but i've never had a problem with it.

if you're interested, here's a page that shows pics of all the cars in the game. http://www.gta-source.com/sa/vehicles.php strange thing is, i've had the game ever since it came out in late 2004, and i still don't think i've seen all the cars that are in it! for instance, there's one that looks a bit like a '70-72 monte carlo, but with just a hint of '60's riviera in it, that i only started seeing just recently. and this thing that looks kinda like a '92 civic hatchback, i've seen it on the x-box version, but not the playstation version."

it's a real task making sure that rust doesn't come back, and a risk, too."
2928,"February 16, 2006 4:10PM",fintail,"yeah, the weather here is pretty mild, and cars survive better. not that they don't rust, it just takes longer. a lot of 80s stuff is just starting to leave the roads now. the datsun 510 i experienced in the mid 90s was almost completely rust-free, and my fintail has been in the area since 1976 (from ca), so it is almost rust free too, and if you go to eastern wa, it is even better...the little town where my dad lives is loaded with old metal, and rust is rare. the $100 datsun 610 he bought last year is amazingly straight and clean. my dad had quite a few older cars in the early 90s especially, and the real only rust problem was in a 60 ford with rusty front floors. everything else was solid."

2931,"February 16, 2006 7:32PM",british_rover,that peugot had some kind of funky sliding rear axel right? i thought i remebered reading that the rear axel/suspension design was very bizare.
2932,"February 16, 2006 10:08PM",gsemike,"the only power option on the lemans is power seat? some of those old cars were optioned out really weird. back in 73, power seat was pretty hard to come by unless you were in a luxury brand. for that car to have that but no windows or locks has to be unusual. i once had a 72 lesebre with power locks and nothing else.

the lincoln could be decent but the paint looks so cheapo even in the pics. a low quality black paint job is never worth doing."
2933,"February 17, 2006 5:59AM",andre1969,"that '74 lemans is just a base, bottom of the heap model. it's not a luxury lemans, which was renamed grand lemans for 1975. the power seat is a real oddity on that car, but actually, even the tilt wheel and cruise control must've been really rare on something in that price class back then.

as for the rear window defogger, i wonder if it has the wires in the rear window, or if it just has a blower?

my '76 grand lemans has a power seat and power windows, and tilt, but no power locks and no cruise. i wish it did have power locks, though, as it's really a stretch to reach across to the passenger-side door. while these were considered intermediates, it's probably wider inside, up front at least, than most of what passes for full-sized cars these days!

i kinda like that '74. if it were closer i'd definitely give it a second look.

that lincoln also isn't bad looking for $1200, especially considering it has the 460. a lot of these were stuck with 400's that only put out around 166 horsepower, and naturally, when you wrap roughly 4600 pounds of car around that, it's going to struggle. the 460 had something like 217 hp though, and a lot more torque, so these things could actually move with some dignity. heck, my buddy with the twin '78 diamond jubilees has scared the hell out of me on several occasions when he drives them!"
2934,"February 17, 2006 6:09AM",andre1969,"heck, i guess i've been pretty deprived. i didn't even have a car with a power seat until 1995, when my uncle sold my wife and me his '88 lebaron turbo coupe. almost a slap in the face, considering some of the ""real"" cars i've had over the years, that the most optioned-up would be a dreaded k-car! :p

since then though, i've had a few power seat cars. my grandma's '85 lesabre, which she gave me in 1999, had a power driver's seat and, oddly, a power recline on the otherwise manual passenger seat. my '79 nyer has a power driver's seat. and the lemans has a power bench seat.

one thing that's kinda strange is back then, they had several different types of power seats. the most common kind, i think, was the ""6-way"", where you had a little joystick control flanked by an up/down switch on either side. however, there was a ""4-way"", which only had the little joystick. i remember seeing a 1978 or so olds 98 coupe at carlisle one year that had the 4-way. honestly, how much money did gm save by offering two different types of power assist? :confuse:"
2935,"February 17, 2006 7:10AM",imidazol97,"i always viewed power seats as something else automated to go bad! but the 4-way vs 6-way vs 8-way probably saved some structural strength cost along with the motors.

first had power seats on 93 lesabre. luckily none have ever broken on me. good gm dependability. go tell cr that power seats lasted 150k on lesabre."
2936,"February 17, 2006 7:20AM",andre1969,"the power seat in my '79 nyer is getting weak. the up/down function on the joystick and the two flanking switches are still fine, but to move the seat forward and back, i have to help it along with my legs!

the power seat in the lemans also seems a bit inconsistent. some days it moves just fine, but others it seems a bit slow. also seems kinda loud, but maybe that's just how they were back then?

now the power seat in my grandma's '85 lesabre still worked great, right up until the day we got rid of that car in 2002!

our lebaron was dead by 1997 or so, so the power seat in that car never got a chance to stand the test of time. i'd thought about pulling them out and putting them in my dart, but that would've looked weird...a white car with a burgundy/black interior, and light brown front buckets!"
2937,"February 17, 2006 7:24AM",imidazol97,"> '79 nyer is getting weak.

have you tried cleaning the seat track to reduce friction and oiling the thing?"
2938,"February 17, 2006 7:43AM",andre1969,"i didn't even think of that. might be a good idea to do, and try to prolong its life. if the thing ever failed completely, i think an m-body power seat (like out of a mid-80's fifth ave) would swap in, but it's not like these things are exactly littering the junkyards anymore.

i'm the only one that drives the car, so i'm usually not messing with the fore-aft position. depending on how my back and body feels though, sometimes i'll still play around with the up/down and tilt adjustments."
2939,"February 17, 2006 7:45AM",imidazol97,i'm thinking about getting under my 98 to see if the track is gunked up with lint and crud. i did that on 93. i also used lithium grease or a spray lube (not wd40) or some kind. just figured it made life easier if it didn't have the extra friction. have you every looked under your seat (the car i mean)? it's nasty.
2940,"February 17, 2006 8:28AM",lemko,"...i had with a power seat was my 1979 buick park avenue. the first car my girlfriend had with a power seat is her 2005 buick lacrosse! the 1 & 2 position memory seat is an excellent feature as my girlfriend is short and petite and i'm tall and hefty. if i accidentally hit her position, i'd be crushed against the steering wheel! she has the rearview mirror positioned so that if i were driving the car, i'd have to look for vehicles coming out of the ground."
2941,"February 17, 2006 9:20AM",fintail,"on the old 85 tempo my parents had when i was a kid, the power seat motor shorted out when i was driving. i was just normally driving down a city street, and smoke started pouring out from under the seat! very uncool. i was still living at home then and the car had been relegated to being a high school car for my sister, so i just found a nearly identical junkyard seat + assembly and fixed it myself."
2942,"February 17, 2006 11:41AM",fintail,"grey market car, right?"
2943,"February 17, 2006 12:05PM",lilengineerboy,"not necessarily, the 930 came to the states in 75-77 or 78 and then disappeared until the mid-80s, iirc. those were a little challenging to drive up through the 90s models. a somewhat benign mistake in a different car would produce a spin in the 930s. while cutting edge for the time, the turbo was basically a lagging power switch. the turbo would lag off the line, then be something of a handful once they started making boost. :blush:"

2945,"February 17, 2006 5:22PM",andre1969,"that '90 lesabre almost makes me wish i was in the market for a station wagon! there's just something about that style that had a smooth sort of handsomeness about it. those awkward '91-96 rolling suppository b-wagons just weren't as classy.

kinda interesting that the lesabre actually seems to be wearing an '80-84 electra grille. as i recall, for a while in the 80's, there was both a lesabre and electra wagon. the electra was still on the shorter b-wheelbase of 116"", whereas an electra/98 were on the 119"" wb, but it had the electra grille, ventiport trim on the fenders, and nicer interior. also, i don't think that's the top trim level. it looks nice, but the seats aren't as plush as what was in my grandma's '85 lesabre.

still, i'd take it if i needed another car, and it were closer. i wonder if that al hubcaps dude, the one with the '86 parisienne safari, is still around?"
2946,"February 17, 2006 7:18PM",fintail,"i am almost ashamed to say that i don't mind that old barge either. back in the day, ca. 1988 an aunt of mine had one of those...it was a pleasing blue, and it was very loaded - leather i think, it had some kind of alloy/mag wheels, etc. it seemed very posh. those do look better than the bloated things that replaced it, too. for a domestic of the period, there's almost an elegance there.

i like that '85 cutlass salon, although i'd put the olds rallyes back on, as mother nature intended. i dunno how rare it is, though...they made like 15,000 of them that year. now if it was a 4-4-2, which they only mad around 3500 i'd say it's rare."
2949,"February 18, 2006 9:35AM",fintail,"i don't think that old barge has abs...the description also says it has fwd, iirc. just a careless seller. however, i think a conversion would be possible on most cars, for the right amount of money. i don't think it would be cheap.

when did gm start in with abs in a big way, maybe ca. 1992? i remember all the ""abs"" badged cavs and corsicas you'd see.

the friend of mine who is a monte nut has an 83 monte cl with wheels from an 81 camaro on it. it doesn't look half bad, mainly because the car is grey and the wheels are similar.

2956,"February 20, 2006 2:07PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i'm afraid you will live to regret that decision, unless you have an extremely good sense of humor.

if you want an audi that will be worth something, try to find a 5000 quattro turbo wagon. that's a car worth having; otherwise, it's money down the drain imo.

btw: the quattro systems aren't the problem...it's everything else attached to it."
2957,"February 20, 2006 2:35PM",lilengineerboy,"actually, if you want a wagon like that, your needs would likely be better served by a 1991 audi 200 quattro avant. its the same car, except with plastics that don't deteriorate, a wire harness that can actually handle current, and best of all, a 20 valve 5 cylinder with turbo, so it is actually almost quick, even by today's standards.
the biggest issue besides the typical audi parts availability, is the ""ufo"" brakes. apparently, the caliper is on the inside of the rotor, which allowed them to use bigger brakes with smaller wheels. most cars have either had the brakes replaced by now, or they have been converted to conventional brakes.
i am partial to the ur-q because it invented the awd sports car, the godfather of the eclipse gsx, evo and sti. i also know enough about the car and its maladies to know what i'm getting into, just too stupid to care."

i even back away from these cars, and my personal good friend owns an audi repair shop."
2960,"February 20, 2006 4:59PM",lilengineerboy,"and this is allowing you can actually find the part. unlike other german auto manufacturers, audi pretty much drops support for anything over 10 years old. anything before the '96 a4, good luck."

i ended up repairing one of the rigid plastic hoses on the expansion tank by epoxying in a bit of pvc pipe. used it to keep the crack from expanding anymore since they wanted like 750 dollars for a new tank."

2971,"February 21, 2006 12:57PM",jrosasmc,"shifty i've seen your comments played out in reality- i saw many audis, saabs and jaguars deteriorate rapidly after about the 5-year mark.

what about volvos, what do you think of their long-term durability? my 1996 850 has 71k miles but it still looks like new. the 240 series is a different story though..."
2972,"February 21, 2006 2:09PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i really have very little experience with volvos after the 240 and 7 and 9 series left the scene--those never impressed me as having much durability in terms of materials or build quality. but they did seem to run a long time, even with most of the parts falling off. so you have to give them some credit. real rattle traps though. i think volvo really improved in the 90s."
2973,"February 21, 2006 6:37PM",fintail,"i will admit it looks like an excellent survivor, but that price sure is up there"
2974,"February 21, 2006 7:00PM",lilengineerboy,"vovlo, like audi, in a way, made a very robust engine. the bf230 series (the 4 cylinder that volvo put in everything) was over built and under stressed, even with a turbo. the issue was with some of the auxiliary systems. volvo doesn't sell that many cars, so they had to adapt more general mainstream components to fit. over the years they have had transmissions from different manufactures as well as interior pieces. they just didn't have the quantity of scale to have top quality for all trim pieces.
then volvo got bought by ford, who put an end to the piece-meal silliness, but hurt the cult standing of the car a bit. eventually, the capitalized on strengths and watered down the brand a bit (ford 500 uses volvo/audi tt awd, ford freestyle similar to xc70...).
one of my friends from where i grew up is driving around his parents 1984 volvo 240 glt wagon they got via european delivery. it still has it's european temporary plates under the california plates. its got like 200k, head has never been off, but its on its 2nd turbo, 3rd driver's seat, 3rd glove box, not original wheel etc. my favorite thing is it still has that back back seat i remember sitting in when we got picked up for soccer when i was 10 or so."

this is another, ""gee, honey, i tried to sell it"" deals."
2981,"February 22, 2006 6:18AM",bumpy,jeebus. it's worth around $2500 in consideration of the low miles. the only way to get $6500 for it is a vvl or turbo swap.
2982,"February 22, 2006 6:45AM",lilengineerboy,"that 2.0l sr20 that is in the ser and the g20 has a big following. it responds well to turbo kits, or can be replaced by an sr20det (although you need a front drive version). even using the jdm primera motor raises the compression and has more aggressive cams, and runs well under a grand.

otherwise, it has a leather interior and the ad says it has a 3.4. but it lists the fuel economy (19/29) of the 3.1. i'm not sure, but i think in the cutlass supreme, the only 3.4 you could get that year was the dohc version, which put out something like 200-215 hp, and had a nice, broad range of power, where in comparison the 3.8 would be close in 0-60, but would lose out in passing, higher-end performance, etc.

3028,"February 24, 2006 5:16PM",jrosasmc,"speaking of italian cars it just occurred to me- is there any particular reason why most ferraris need a major service performed at 30k miles? it seems as if they need either valve jobs or timing belts done around that time.

i wonder what would happen to a ferrari if someone maintained it like a toyota or chevy."
3029,"February 24, 2006 11:08PM",Mr_Shiftright,"ferraris are built to a very narrow engineering range, that is, to perform at extremes of endurence and rpm.

if you maintained a ferrari like a chevy or toyota it would blow up.

if you drove a toyota or chevy like a ferrari, they would blow up."
3030,"February 25, 2006 7:41AM",british_rover,"i was just talking to a customer of mine and on his new ferrari at like 9,000 or 12,000 miles he needs a complete service that includes removal of the engine to do the timing chain.

i don't even remember how much it cost at this point cause my mind drifted away as we were looking at his car."
3031,"February 25, 2006 9:25AM",Mr_Shiftright,"for just about any used ferrari, figure roughly $1.50 a mile to drive and maintain it (not including gas and insurance).

so if you see that old 308 or 328 for a tasty price, keep in mind that you haven't begun to spend yet. with a ferrari, a 60,000 mile car is practically a parts car---not that they won't go 60k, not at all, but that the maintenance requirements get higher and higher.

this is why you see so many ferraris being sold just shy of the 30k mark---because that's when the $6,000 major serivce is due."
3032,"February 25, 2006 10:56AM",fintail,looks like a good old beater

3037,"February 25, 2006 3:23PM",lilengineerboy,"i was thinking how ridiculous it is to drop the motor for basic maintenance, then i realized the subaru requires some motor twisting to get the plugs out/adjust the valves, (i think its loosening the motor mount and twisting it to clear the frame rail, the price of a low cg i guess) and the porsche boxter doesn't even have a hood. at 60k, the motor is dropped, the plugs and belts changed, and re-installed. again, might be part of why so many boxters get dumped at 58k. as a caveat, i don't think its terribly difficult to pull the engine, but it has to come out through the bottom, so i would imagine its dropping the whole sub frame.
as an aside, i'm down with the old school chevelle. it just needs a drop, airbags and some 20s :p . okay, just kidding."
3038,"February 25, 2006 3:48PM",andre1969,"a buck fifty per mile?! jeezus chrysler! i kept pretty good records on my '68 dart, and it ran around 11 cents per mile, plus gas & insurance. and that was taking it from 253,000 miles to 338,000. and amortizing the $1700 purchase price over those 85,000 miles!

heck, i think even my intrepid, which now has around 114,000 miles on it, only cost around 27 cents per mile, plus gas & insurance. and that's including the purchase price ($22,389 out the door, with tax, tags, an extended warranty i never had the pleasure of using, etc) amortized over those miles.

i used to joke that the intrepid's cost per mile would never get down to the level of the dart's cost per mile, but after hearing $1.50 per mile for a ferrari, those other cpms are negligible!

now would the ferrari's cost per mile go down if you drove it more? for example, if i drove my intrepid more and, say, it had 150,000 miles on it rather than 114,000, the cpm would be lower, because most likely i wouldn't have had to put much more $ into it, other than maintenance and maybe some tires, while the big cost factors would be spread over higher miles. or is a ferrari so high-maintenance that if you drive it more, you just get to the point where more things break on it quicker?"

a ferrari shop has all the special tools to pull the motor and this makes it easier (for him, not you) . a regular mechanic can't even work on the car. even the computer scan tools are unique. there's a special frame you roll under the car and attach the motor and subframe to that. a fan belt is $100 and there are perhaps 6 or 7 of those (special size, cogged, etc.)"

3047,"February 26, 2006 9:21AM",andre1969,"is a ferrari to ride in? i can't imagine that something that low-slung is going to have much interior room, ride very comfortably, or be very quiet with that engine right behind you.

i don't doubt that they're fun...in small doses. i mean, roller coasters and go-karts are, too. but after riding a go-kart for about a half-hour, you're pretty beat-up, and the last time i went to kings dominion, those roller coasters had me pretty bruised and battered by the end of the day, too!

to me, a ferrari sounds like a car that would be better suited to rent and take out on a closed course and have some fun with. and then give it back when you're done with it, so you don't get stuck with all the costs. or, if you were so filthy rich that a buck fifty per mile was chicken-droppings."

3055,"February 27, 2006 10:25AM",lemmer,"fulvia

oh yeah, that car (if in very good shape) should be worth $12,000--$15,000. it's a steal at $5k if it's a straight car. you could double your money.

wouldn't call it ""rare"" though--they made about 7,000 of them....

turns out you were exactly right. it was a steal... of someone's ebay account. i bid on the car. ebay cancelled the auction because of fraud/illegal use of an account or something."
3056,"February 27, 2006 10:33AM",british_rover,wow i wonder how often that happens.
3057,"February 27, 2006 10:41AM",fintail,"i had that same matchbox capri...i think it was a pinkish red metallic. i too remember sending cars to the 'crusher' - for me it was an old foot operated/sewing machine with the cast iron bottom...i would get that thing going fast and it would smash a car. i remember a majorette saab 99 ended up there...i wish i had that car now. probably no more than a $5-10 item today.

and yeah, the earlier capris were better. i wonder how many bloated ones are still left.

3058,"February 27, 2006 11:50AM",lemmer,"pretty often, i think.

about a week before the fulvia i put in a lowball bid on a nice local 240sx. ebay took away the listing and sent me a similar email.

it has happened to me a couple of times before that also. i have always just been a lowball bidder in all the instances. i doubt i would even send a deposit to most individuals. i would just go look at the car almost immediately, and pay for it if was as represented."
3059,"February 27, 2006 11:56AM",british_rover,yeah that worries me about ebay buying. finding good local cars can be hard and i wouldn't want to bid on a car that i couldn't go take a look at first.

gotta stay away from 80s german cars. so this car needs serious motor work (bent valve) which means one of the pistons is probably fubar, being an interference design, which would put me instantly upside down as far as repair costs vs car value. the motor should probably be gone through anyway, the front seals are pretty notorious in early cars for leaking...oh and i heard something about the steering system but can't remember what.

3077,"February 28, 2006 6:21AM",andre1969,"i wonder how many buffoons will think it has a big-block under the hood, though? one mistake chrysler made was giving cars trim level names that were the same as engine displacements.

i remember a few years back, someone wanted to buy my '68 dart. now i told him that i honestly didn't know what v-8 it had. the guy i bought it from told me it was a 318, rebuilt around the 242,000 mile mark, and it definitely has some kick to it, but years later when i did a vin decode, i found out it originally only had a 273. i don't think you can tell the difference between a 318 and 273 just from looking at them. it's stamped on the block, but on my car it's hard to access, and covered with years of gunk. anyway, after i told the guy that, he said ""oh, it's a 270"". what?! i told him that a 270 was an old dodge engine from the 50's. i think it was offered both as a hemi and a poly-head. ""no, it's a 270. says so right on the car."" now that one i couldn't figure out. my car says ""v-8"" on the fenders and ""dodge"" on the hood, and that's it. i pulled off the trim that said ""dart"" when i repainted it, and never bothered to put it back on. then, it finally hit me. on the glovebox door, it says ""dart 270"". this buffoon, a self-proclaimed dart expert, mistook the trim level for the engine displacement! :blush:

3101,"March 1, 2006 11:11AM",andre1969,"if you were really intent on hyper-miling it, you might, under optimal circumstances, get to 30 mpg once in a blue moon. for instance, if you went on a long trip and part of that trip took you across a flat desert in the springtime, and you kept it around the 55-60 mark, no a/c, etc. my grandparents actually got 29 mpg out of their '85 lesabre on one stretch of a cross-country trip in those conditions. the car was epa-rated around 17/24. best i could ever get out of it was around 22 though.

however, that lesabre had an overdrive tranny and a 2.73 axle, so once it went into top gear it was effectively a 1.82x ratio. even at 90 mph the sucker was barely loafing. however, gm didn't have overdrive automatics in the 70's. and i'm guessing a 6-cyl camaro is going to have a shorter axle ratio, of 2.9x+, to compensate for the lack of power, so it's not going to be a fuel sipper either. now i'd imagine that on the highway that camaro might make lower 20's, but i just don't see 30 mpg happening. these things weighed almost as much as a downsized caprice/impala!"

3115,"March 2, 2006 6:46AM",andre1969,"those pics are small enough, and low-res enough that they might hide a whole plethora of flaws. plus, it looks like it's been repainted. the paint just looks too nice and shiny compared to the under-hood area.

those fuselage bodies really tucked in at the bottoms, so a lot of the rust wouldn't be noticeable unless you got down on your knees and looked at it. i can almost guarantee that the lower rear quarters are rusty. it looks like it's been eaten away right behind the rear wheel, although it's partially obscured by shadow.

the '74-78 mopars were actually worse in this regard, of hiding rust. even though they were much more squared-off, they still had a lot of tuck-in, for lack of a better word, where the lower body wrapped up under."

and for some reason the model name ""fireflite"" often gets a bit botched, but i can understand that a bit better, since it was usually written in a cursive with a backward slant, and sometimes a bit difficult to read. i've seen it spelled ""fireflight"" and ""fireflyte"". and i guess ""fireflight"" would be a more grammatically correct spelling, while ""fireflyte"" just looks like a spelling they would have come up with in the 50's!

really nice looking bustleback

neat looking little ragtop"
3122,"March 2, 2006 9:27AM",british_rover,"i kind of like the valiant.

i don't really like convertiables in general unless they are old or huge. old and huge really are the best ones. i couldn't drive a miata cause i can't fit in one comfortably and it is just not fast enough to subject myself to that torture.

an elise on the other hand is a different story."
3123,"March 2, 2006 9:42AM",andre1969,"looks like a canadian model, which was basically a dart with a valiant front clip. now in later years that wouldn't have made much difference, but in '63 the dart's wheelbase was 5"" longer (111"" versus 106"") and at least 8"" longer overall (~196"" versus ~188"")

one thing i don't like about most little modern convertibles, especially 2-seaters, is that you sit so low in them, and the window sills and dash are so high, and the windshield rakes back so far that even with the top down, i still end up with a claustrophobic, hemmed in feeling. i actually get more of an ""open air"" experience if i roll down both windows in my truck and open the rear sliding window!"
3124,"March 2, 2006 9:44AM",imidazol97,i'd forgotten the valiant convertibles. nice cars. but the people complaining about the interiors on gms (and others) would go apoplectic about the dash and seats. the seville looks nice inside.
3125,"March 2, 2006 10:37AM",fintail,"i'll admit i like that bustleback...nice condition, good color combo, no carriage top or continental kit...maybe put some kind of period caddy wheels on it instead of those caps...might be a coolish car. depends on whats under the hood.

old mopar interiors are freaky, but are they low quality? that's the issue."
3126,"March 2, 2006 10:40AM",andre1969,"that valiant/dart would be low-quality, but if you compared it to a falcon, comet, corvair, or chevy ii interior, it would probably be comparable. and compared to a cheap import at the time, you'd be looking at state-of-the-art! one area where mopar was definitely ahead was gauges. you got an amp and temp gauge standard with the valiant/dart, but iirc the chevy ii and corvair only had a fuel gauge. falcon too, i think...or it may have at least had a temp gauge. now something a bit more upscale like a tempest/f-85/special would probably have a nicer interior, but again, stingier on the gauges."
3127,"March 2, 2006 11:35AM",Mr_Shiftright,you and will part ways on that car. i remember when the bustleback came out and people actually laughed at it. this was at cadillac's low point of course and it was thought ridiculous that cadillac would have pretensions to clumsy imitations of edwardian styling cues from rolls royce. so we were looking at the car from a different (and i think accurate for the times) perspective of what it was.
3128,"March 2, 2006 11:45AM",fintail,"the interest is in the cheesiness. it's the 80s version of a car with big fins, and i have memories of those from when i was little. that was the tail end of the pimpy times....which unfortunately are not over at caddy."
3129,"March 2, 2006 11:46AM",fintail,"another decent enough looking old beater/driver

kind of cool but i doubt the auto is a good thing"
3130,"March 2, 2006 11:48AM",british_rover,i like the 2002. i have always wanted one and i wonder how hard it would be to convert that to manual.
3131,"March 2, 2006 11:53AM",andre1969,"because its style is a nice blend of 80's modern and classic 30's. and it was pretty influential, as the imperial aped it somewhat for '81-83, as did those fairmont-based continentals and the mark vii, to a lesser degree.

in contrast a rolls royce is more like a 1939 packard that they just did the best they could to try and update. at least, that's what bill mitchell said.

the '80-85 seville was also a solid seller for cadillac, although the recession in the early 80's did keep it from realizing its full potential. it certainly sold much better than the shrunken '86-91 style, and the '92+ style that followed. although i thought the '92+ seville was a damned worthy car.

i think the only thing that would scare me away from an '80-85 is the sucky engines that most of them had. i believe the 1980 had a caddy 368 standard, and could actually move out with some authority. but alot of them were stuck with olds diesels. in '81 they had that v-8-6-4, but i think if you disable the cylinder deactivation and make it run on 8 cylinders all the time you're fine. the diesel was again a popular option in 1981. then for '82-85 they used those tiny 4.1 aluminum v-8's. consumer guide got a 1985 brougham with the 135 hp version of that engine from 0-60 in 14.8 seconds. but the seville only had 125 hp, and weighed about the same, so it would've been even more dog-like. not to mention unreliable.

the '75-79 seville was probably more of a road car though. still, i do have a fondness for the '80-85. nice, distinctive, almost customized look to it."

3135,"March 2, 2006 2:10PM",andre1969,"i'm just playing devil's advocate here! i remember driving an early 80's seville years ago that a local used car lot had. i thought it was cool, because it was ritzy and plush. and had an awesome stereo. but gawd was it slow! the ponderousness of it really didn't hit me though, because i was accustomed to things like '85 silverados and lesabres, and the seville was considerably shorter, and a lot narrower. i think they were only about 71-72 inches wide, which puts it in range with stuff like an altima, accord, camry, etc.

mt or c&d did a comparison test of a 1980 seville, 1980 continental mark vi, and a 1980 nyer 5th avenue. the seville did 0-60 in 10.6 seconds, which is nothing to brag about today, but for the time i thought it was pretty impressive. the lincoln did it in 11.0. the nyer did pretty poor though, at 14 seconds. however, the caddy had a 368 with gobs of torque, and i believe the lincoln had a 351, also very torquey. the nyer was stuck with a 318-2bbl with 120 hp and not much torque, so it just wasn't a fair match. the 360 in '80 only had 130 hp in 2-bbl form, but would've had a lot more torque. there was also a 4-bbl version with 185 hp, but nobody in 1980 was going to test a car like that, what with the fuel scares going on.

anyway, i can't remember if they picked a real winner or not in that test. i think they just went through and listed all the good points and bad points of each car, and said if you were looking for such-and-such a feature, then such-and-such a car would suit your needs the best."
3136,"March 2, 2006 2:22PM",Mr_Shiftright,well i'm not a big fan of cars that are incompetent in every department...but i guess it takes as much genius to do everything wrong as it does to do it right!! :shades: those sevilles are kinda the joan rivers of luxury cars.
3137,"March 2, 2006 2:57PM",stickguy,"my issue of autoweek just came. in the bwtw page (at the end) they show an ad from some paper for a late 70's seville. it is referred to as a showcar, and a classic, and they want 18k for it!"
3138,"March 2, 2006 3:00PM",stickguy,"the latest issue of car & driver had a feature about racing $1,500 beaters from detroit to la. kicker is, they all had to be diesels! they ended up with a well used benz and maxima, and a surprisinly well preserved olds 88 coupe.

the article itself is quite funny. and getting back to the topic, if you want one for your next project, they will be getting sold on ebay later this month!"
3139,"March 2, 2006 3:03PM",british_rover,wait they made a maxima diesel?
3140,"March 2, 2006 3:05PM",stickguy,"back in the late 70's/early 80's, they made all kinds of nasty diesels. volvo (i think here), escort/tempo, maxima, and others that i have thankfully forgot."
3141,"March 2, 2006 3:07PM",british_rover,"yeah i have seen a lot of the funny euro and american diesel but i have never seen a [non-permissible content removed] diesel that i can think of.

i just did not think they made one."
3142,"March 2, 2006 3:07PM",imidazol97,">volvo (i think here), escort/tempo, maxima, and others that i have thankfully forgot.

was there a chevette diesel?"
3143,"March 2, 2006 3:10PM",british_rover,i think so. i used to work on a really bad mid 80s ford ranger diesel. little four cylinder diesel that had two oil filters and held like 9 quarts of oil.
3144,"March 2, 2006 3:18PM",andre1969,"there was a chevette diesel. it used an isuzu 1.8 4-cyl diesel. i think that was the only small gm car that was diesel-ized, though. although maybe the spectrum did in 1985? all of their midsized and larger cars offered a diesel at some point, though. bigger, heavier models like the b/c and e/k (eldorado/seville) offered a 5.7. the intermediate rwd (a/g) offered the 5.7, but i think some offered a 4.3 v-6 that was a chopped v-8, and one or two years the 4.3/260 olds v-8 was also diesel-ized. the 4.3 v-6 diesel also went into the 1985 electra/98/deville as i recall, and i think the fwd a-bodies (celebrity, century, et al) offered it too.

ford offered a diesel escort and tempo. with bigger cars though, only the fairmont-based continental sedan and the mark vii offered a diesel. it was a bmw unit, a 2.4 inline 6 iirc.

i don't think chrysler ever offered any diesel cars, although there were plans at one time to convert the slant six to diesel. some of the mitsubishi-badged imports may have offered one, though."
3145,"March 2, 2006 4:16PM",michaellno,"yep, i almost made the mistake of buying a new escort diesel in 1985.

i had totalled my '79 sunbird and had $2k of insurance cash burning a hole in my pocket. i was only a few months away from graduating college, so i thought a new car would be the way to go. the ford dealer offered to defer my payments for 90 days.

fortunately, my parents talked me out of it, as i didn't yet have a job lined up post-graduation. in retrospect, that was probably a good decision."
3146,"March 2, 2006 4:28PM",imidazol97,isn't it amazing how much smarter our parents get as we get older ourselves!
3147,"March 2, 2006 6:56PM",bumpy,toyota and nissan both had their own diesels that they put in their cars and (more commonly) trucks in the early '80s. the scout ii used a nissan diesel for a few years in the late '70s.
3148,"March 2, 2006 7:23PM",fintail,"i am pretty sure this was posted some time ago...but i kinda like it, so here it is again

i really want to see a pic of this"
3149,"March 2, 2006 11:17PM",ghulet,"i remember a friend's family in high school had an escort diesel. not so bad, believe it or not; helped immensely that it had a stick; actually any fords of the era with stick were better, their automatics had the most annoying shift points/gear ratios--they'd rev forever, then shift and chug along powerless til you got up in the revs, awful.

my grandfather was likely one of the only people to own both an escort and chevette diesel. rip, grandpa hulet!

i don't remember chrysler having any diesels--did they? anyone remember the lincoln mark vii diesel, which had the same engine as the bmw 524td. as far as japanse diesels go, i do remember the maxima, definitely a first-generation camry, and an isuzu p'up, iirc. no mazdas, as far as i know."
3150,"March 3, 2006 8:39AM",lemko,anybody interested in a 1988 chrysler park avenue?

3152,"March 3, 2006 10:49AM",lemko,there's a yellow 1970 lincoln sedan rotting away on a repair shop lot i pass on my way to work each day. it's next to an equally decrepit yellow and white 1958 chevrolet bel air
3153,"March 3, 2006 11:22AM",lilengineerboy,"if it hadn't been for the olds delta 88 diesel in the late 70s, i think this country wouldn't feel the way it does about a renewable energy source that would reduce our dependence on foreign oil. wow, that sounds like a commercial.
in high school, my friends had vw, peugeot, and mbz diesels. the turbo diesels were great, as soon as the waste gate opened you could leave a smokescreen behind you...or just smoke out the kids at the bus stop who made fun of your diesel.
i did a lot of miles in the peugeot 505s turbo diesel, thats actually the car that was used when i was taught to drive stick. if i could find a cheap mbz 190d w/ a 4spd or 5spd, i would consider that for daily transport (running bio-diesel, of course)."
3154,"March 3, 2006 12:26PM",Mr_Shiftright,"diesel fuel is .40 to .50 more per gallon that regular gas where i live, so there is no justification for putting up with a slow smelly 190d where i live at least.

once the new generation diesels are allowed into california, and once we have a supply of the new low-sulphur diesel fuel, i think diesels might be a great alternative in california. but for now, they don't make much sense. personally i don't have the time to haul peanut oil out of chinese restaurants, filter and treat it and heat it and run it through a primitive diesel car that's 30 years old (gee i made it sound ever worse than it is, didn't i? sorry).

bio-diesel is great but $$$ if you buy it at the pump.

ethanol and other grain fuels really don't give the energy back that it costs to produce them. that's why ethanol is a federally subsidized industry. it can't compete in a free market."
3155,"March 3, 2006 1:03PM",lilengineerboy,"so i did some googling. epas website lists the fuel mileage for a 80s 190d @ 29/37 and an 80s 190e (gas) at 21/28. the annual fuel cost for the diesel is $1160, and gas $1532. gas was assumed to be 2.25/gal (about what it is in ann arbor as of last night) and diesel was 2.47 (again, seemed in line with what i found on gas buddy.com)
bio-diesel is about the same price here, but considerably harder to find, although even ""standard"" diesel around here is ~10% bio-diesel.
if you don't want something slow, noisy and smelly, and live outside ca, there are new vw tdis.
the nice thing about m85 is it requires very few modifications to a gas motor to work. i think as peak oil approaches, and getting oil out of the ground becomes more expensive, it may be a more realistic option. hopefully not in my lifetime. i'm going to be really ticked if i restore something and then have to crush and refine my own dinosaurs to get gas for it to run. :mad:"
3156,"March 3, 2006 1:07PM",lemmer,"he just dropped the price from $13,900."
3157,"March 3, 2006 1:32PM",Mr_Shiftright,seems like fair price for the car.
3158,"March 3, 2006 2:21PM",stickguy,"looks nice. a little high on miles, but based on the ad, the expensive stuff has ben taken care of. could do a lot worse for 11k.

i think the w126 cars, along with its mercedes brethren and some porsches, were some of the very few shining stars of very early '90s cars in terms of quality and driving experience."
3162,"March 3, 2006 5:40PM",lilengineerboy,"vovlo's diesel in the 700 series was shared with 2 other companies, maybe volkswagen and peugeot or something. it was considered ahead of its time and one of the fastest diesels of the day.
today, volvo does do a diesel, just not in the us. the main reason there are no diesels here is emissions concern, the slow/stinky/loud reputation and preference.
diesel technology is much further along in europe. the have developed particulate traps and other devices to clean up diesel exhaust (like gasoline cars have catalytic converters), and with innovations like the tdi volkswagens and direct injection merchryslers (i think they call it crd), they aren't so stinky or slow. i think if they could get rid of the diesel noise at start up (they already did at idle), you wouldn't know you were driving a diesel."
3163,"March 3, 2006 6:45PM",xwesx,"cold weather is not iffy for diesels as long as you use the correct fuel. #1 from the pump is not going to cause freezing at any temperatures seen in commonly inhabited areas. if you use #2 or similar biodiesels, then you'd better put an additive in there to keep it from turning to gel! :sick:"

3169,"March 4, 2006 5:13PM",Mr_Shiftright,"no but that car is way down in the rear. new springs and shocks ain't cheap and the car will just pogo stick over every hard bump and pound your spine if you don't fix it. so it's a very necessary repair and this makes the car a $3,000 car, not a $1,600 one imo."
3170,"March 4, 2006 5:20PM",imidazol97,"correct me if i'm wrong (as if the guys on edmunds wouldn't!!!) but did buicks come with red rims and red door frames and the classic blue paint along with white top. i don't recall that combination. has the color been changed?

dad had one of these blue 55's that had been my uncles. dad bought it on a large. i drove it while i was rebuilding my 67 mustang motor in 68 when it had a strange, occasional freeze up. the car was a dream. no shift transmission. powerful. smooth. gashog."

3172,"March 5, 2006 10:28AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i suppose some backyard jockey could replace the shocks and springs but if he tackled the carb he'd be dead meat. benzes do not tolerate work that is ""close"" to right. i was figuring $1,000 for parts alone."
3173,"March 5, 2006 10:57AM",fintail,this doesn't look bad
3174,"March 5, 2006 3:32PM",andre1969,"could very well be original in its color scheme. here's a link to a 1955 buick brochure. now it looks like they had a tendency to do the rims in a color that accented the body, but check out the roadmaster on page five. the body is blue, while the interior and rims are red!

now a red interior seems to work best with a red, white, or black exterior. imo though, blue does seem workable. so do some cremes and pale yellows, if they're the right color. and grays and silvers, to an extent."
3175,"March 5, 2006 3:45PM",andre1969,"is the rear end on that car indeed sagging, or is the front just raised up too high? imo, it looks like the back is about ""normal"" height. up front though, it makes me think of car you see in the junkyard or around repair shops that have no engine in them. maybe someone replaced the front shocks or springs with components that were too heavy-duty, and that raised it up?"
3176,"March 5, 2006 3:51PM",imidazol97,"i didn't remember a brilliant color contrast from those days... not to quibble but the blue the red is with is the darker blue. i wonder if it was available with the lighter blue. that's what the car in the pic was.

i do recall the 1957 olds having bright yellow with black and some other bright color combos. so it's not as radical the buick may have been a field leader with red on blue!!!

3199,"March 7, 2006 11:25AM",andre1969,"that '78 eldorado has enough torque that it can still throw you back in your seat the moment you jab the gas pedal. a lot of cars from that era that had low horsepower and restrictive gearing, but still had a lot of torque, could do it. but you'd still end up with an underwhelming 0-60 and quarter mile time. and those big, rumbly engines sounded powerful, even if they weren't, so that might have made the cars feel more powerful than they are.

just out of curiosity, would a 425 in an eldorado be much slower than the 500? i think hp was close to the same, around 185-190, but i'm sure torque was way down. i know the 425 wasn't a bad performer for the time in the '77-79 deville/fleetwood, but those were considerably lighter than the pre-downsized eldorados."

3216,"March 8, 2006 11:56AM",lemko,i remember those 1971-72 fords extremely well and not always for the best reasons. they did have those massive three element grilles. of course they rusted with a vengeance and weren't terribly reliable. i heard a rumor that the steel was either recycled or imported and was of inferior quality. was there a steel strike that year or something?
3217,"March 8, 2006 5:13PM",xwesx,"yes, i prefer the 66/7 as well. the front end of the '68 is just.... odd. the car is just in such nice condition, it is hard to slight it for a bit of oddity. shoot, look at my '69 econoline.... you know i cannot hold a bit of ugliness against a vehicle. :p"
3218,"March 8, 2006 7:14PM",ghulet,"this one looks nice (can't tell the quality of what is probably a repaint, though), but it's an automatic and the price is nuts:

below: hate rear (or any) window tints, especially in chicago (this isn't fl or tx), hate the color, no mention of miles, the 'my dad fixed this before he gave it to me' scares me, the price is more than a bit optimistic ($5k should be the end of the world), imo, and am i the only one who thinks a short wheelbase on a 7-series (or an s-class, for that matter) is a bit of a waste (you still get the small back seat, but all the extra bulk):

3222,"March 8, 2006 8:17PM",lilengineerboy,"the 740 depends which v8 it had. one was a nagasil and on an asaki or something, one started with a and one with n. one of the blocks was poor and the other one was very strong. i don't know which is which but if you are seriously considering it, look it up.
the 6 ser in the 70s had thermal reactors that cooked head gaskets (my friend had a '78 530i that cooked then got a '80 528i that was my favorite car for a long time)
the 6-ser is starting to get talked about as being collectable though, although i would go for a mid to late 80s m6."

3224,"March 9, 2006 9:55AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i agree on the 740 -- money pit extraordinaire. you might as well get ahead of the game and just set fire to $5,000 worth of $100 bills for openers.

633 - hard to say but parts will be hell to find and pay for, and really there's nothing exceptional about this car. you are better off shopping for a mid to late 80s 635 series with an automatic. the stickshifts in a big bmw are no fun..the car is too large...5 series on down for manual transmissions.

325 convertible -- seller has to get real on the price, is the main problem. the 3 series is the best bmw (then, as now). be careful of cracked cylinder heads on 80s bimmers though, and those 3 series convertible top mechanisms like to jam and screw up. so i'd work the top a gazillion times before buying it, if it was an electric top."

aren't those things money pits, too? also, is there really any advantage to having a v-12 that small? i mean, a 5.0 isn't even a very big v-8! i guess the v-12 would have a nicer sound to it though, and possibly be smoother?"

3250,"March 12, 2006 10:44AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i always try to advise people that if they are selling any old car, and they have someone who is putting real money on the table, and that pile of money agrees with current price guides, that they'd better think twice before turning it down....because you might not see another buyer for a long, long time.

the only explanation i can offer is that the seller is a consignor and is restrained from selling by the real owner.

private sellers are allowed to be delusional, but professional dealers should know better or be prepared to go out of business."
3251,"March 12, 2006 1:58PM",fintail,"you need to look for maintenance and servicing. especially the transmission. these cars have a supposed 'lifetime' transmission that the dealers will claim never needs servicing. it's bogus. the most common, and really the only major failure area on these cars are the transmissions. make sure it has been serviced by 60k or so.

i would also look for cars with stable ownership, preferrably one owner cars. some of the ones that are abused change hands a bit. they are kind of like little 4 door race cars (with a slushbox), and some people have been known to ride them hard.

i like this previous style (w202) much more than the current one, in amg form. it has aged pretty well, although it looks very plain in lower line cars.

that pretty fintail would be worth 10k in europe..."
3252,"March 12, 2006 2:07PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well it was worth 10k here in america, too, or at least this car on this day, it was. maybe a european bid on it, since they are using euros, which gives them about 25% discount off the us dollar. that would pay his shipping."
3253,"March 13, 2006 7:00AM",british_rover,"ok i had forgoten about the silly mercedes transmission that does not ""need"" servicing.

what about the previous generation c36 i know those are much rarer then the c43 but i figure the straight six in those cars would be a little easier for me to service myself."

3255,"March 13, 2006 10:07AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i'd be wary, too. as a '77 it has the ""engine of death"" and since the miles are low, probably none of the necessary upgrades have been done. probably a whole pile of trouble just waiting to happen. poor suckers who bid don't know their porsches."
3256,"March 13, 2006 6:26PM",fintail,"a c43 and c36 are different experiences, or so i have heard. the c43 is a bit more laid back and not so furious. the powerful v8/small car combo doesn't need to be pushed hard to move, where the c36 needs a little more involvement. i think it is a bit harder to find a really nice c36, as they seem to have attracted more tuners/racers. but yeah, i suspect the maintenance is easier. i think the c36 has at least marginally less gadgetry too."
3257,"March 13, 2006 7:21PM",british_rover,"there are several on cars.com now. none really that close to me and that is not a car i would want to buy without a through inspection by myself and an expert.

i saw one running around in a snow storm over the winter, all full of salt and snow. it made me sad."
3260,"March 14, 2006 12:27PM",fintail,"a 500e is very cool. they were actually assembled by porsche in zuffenhausen too, iirc.

there was a 1993 example at a specialty lot here a few months back. it had something like 10k miles on it, and it was as new. they wanted $40k for it though! getting really tough to find a good example, most have been relegated to normal old used cars."

were i at least 2000 miles closer, i'd at least have a look at it. but then, i am a sucker for the 67-72 (preference toward 67-69). :blush:"

does anyone have more info on them?"
3269,"March 14, 2006 6:32PM",Mr_Shiftright,"as i recall they weren't really awd, but rather manually engaged 4wd, like those clunky old subarus, eagles, etc. this level of primitiveness, coupled to a whopping 100 hp engine, probably did not make for anything pleasant or ahead of its time either. i think you could only get these 4wd cars in 4-doors."
3270,"March 14, 2006 6:34PM",british_rover,there was a brief time in the mid to late 80's where just about everything was made in awd. there was even an awd pontiac 6000. i have seen one in my entire lifetime and that was in the parking lot of a junk yard. not actually in the junk yard though just out in the customer parking area.
3271,"March 14, 2006 6:44PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well those technically aren't awd, which would be a full-time system, right?"
3272,"March 14, 2006 8:21PM",british_rover,i think the system in the 6000 was awd. there was not any lever or anything like in the old eagles and subarus.
3273,"March 14, 2006 8:58PM",bumpy,"there's lots of weird stuff in that gmc. the hood, grille, and side markers aren't '67, the steering wheel is at the wrong angle, that second shifter isn't the usual 4wd lever, and the toro-flow diesel is most definitely not stock (though the bucket seats and console could be).

the toro-flow was converted from the gmc gas v6 and was an ornery beast that liked to eat head gaskets. the gas v6 was massively overbuilt, so the diesel version wasn't overstressed (except for those gaskets). the biggest problem is finding parts, since the toro-flow was rare when it was new. a marine supply house that's been in business forever is probably your best hope."
3274,"March 15, 2006 10:54AM",lilengineerboy,"i believe the tempo had a provision to lock the diffs (ie 80s quattros) but it was on a strict you break it you bought it case. the car really needed to be on a slippery surface to use the diff lock or it would self destruct. the audi recommendation was to lock 1 diff for slippery conditions and lock the other as a remedy once stuck.
i miss the pre-crv honda civic wagovans with ""real-time"" all wheel drive and the creeper 1st gear. while totally gutless (although the example i am familiar with was high mileage) it always got us to the slopes."
3275,"March 15, 2006 12:25PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i think there was definitely a lever on the subarus...the eagle,too...maybe it was like the old toyota tercels, etc, etc...i don't think any of these were real awd cars. you had to ""do something"" to get them into 4wd, either a lever or button or something. they weren't full time awd. the old subarus were very crude nasty cars and the eagle i remember was dog slow and a real gas hog.

the pontiac 6000 was a true awd but only offered as an automatic. i wonder if they used audi technology?...probably, since they made very few of these cars."
3276,"March 15, 2006 2:35PM",british_rover,not sure i never actually worked on one and have only ever seen the one in person. if i ever got one up on a lift i could probably identify the revelant bits of borrowed technology.
3277,"March 15, 2006 3:41PM",Mr_Shiftright,well the electronic locking diffs really suggests audi tech.
3278,"March 16, 2006 12:08PM",xwesx,"while crude, the old subarus of the '80s certainly were not ""nasty"" cars. my father owned one from 1980-1987 when it was destroyed in a head-on collision. to me, something like that mb 750il is a nasty car. :p the subaru did not spend even a day in the shop during its operational life!"
3279,"March 16, 2006 12:12PM",xwesx,"that's interesting to note about the 2nd shifter.... i cannot see the front axle well enough to determine if there are locking hubs on the wheels, but it sits low enough to the ground to make me think it is a 2wd. i wonder if that is perhaps a pto lever rather than a 4wd lever. after all, a diesel/1-ton is definitely a work truck and back in the days of real work trucks, they often came with ptos! i just have never seen a pto-equipped vehicle without 4wd. :confuse:"

3282,"March 16, 2006 1:12PM",andre1969,"with those downsized land yachts is that while as new cars they were much better than the mastodons they replaced, but as antique cars people just prefer the overblown flambuoyance of the bigger, pre-downsized cars?

the '77-79 caddies were actually wildly popular when new, but in '77-79 you could still get a mammoth mark v or continental sedan/town coo-pay, and in '77-78 you could get a toronado, eldorado, newport/new yorker, or ltd/grand marquis in the plus sizes. now i know that the market isn't exactly clamoring for late 70's cars anyway, but it seems that for those that want them, they usually want the biggest, pimpiest, most flambuoyant of them all!

i wouldn't mind having that '78 caddy though. heck, last fall i was considering a '78 electra in close to that same color!"
3283,"March 16, 2006 2:20PM",lemko,where were these cars in november? i would've purchased that '78 caddy in a new york second! those aftermarket wire wheelcover would have to go in favor of stock wires or wheel discs. it also needs a hood ornament - non-wreath to be correct.

3285,"March 16, 2006 4:43PM",xwesx,"oh.... haha.... right. i never minded it, but then i had little with which to compare it: a '71 ford econoline and a '79 f150. :blush:

admittedly, when he replaced the gl with an '85 toyota camry, i thought the ride was rather luxurious. so, maybe that in itself speaks volumes! :p

as far as driving experience, i am rather easy going. i like all my driving experiences, whether it is 1200 miles in a '69 econoline with no brakes, a wrx,a cadillac, a 40' delivery box, a snazzy 38' class a motorhome.... whatever. i enjoy the drive. granted, some of those listed might become tedious week after week. i have never had the privilege of driving or even riding in many of the vehicles you folks debate so often here, so my opinions might change relative to my experiences."
3286,"March 16, 2006 4:52PM",xwesx,"if you are asking me to define pto, it stands for ""power take-off."" it is an auxilliary attachment point for gear-driven attachments. examples of this include winches, snow augers, farm attachments (for tractors, but i have also seen them pulled by willys and old broncos), you name it. it typically is an add-on from the transfer case and is engaged via a lever in the cab.

they were probably most often used for winches, and this function has now been taken over by electric winches."

i guess that he just had the engine rebuilt for fun since the car never broke down. seriously, it looks pretty good for the money. the engine must have cost at least that much.

as long as you have eyes wide open, i think that you'll get the blessing on my people here."
3291,"March 17, 2006 6:39AM",andre1969,"had one of those old subes, but i can't remember if hers was new enough to be called ""loyale"" or one of the older ones before they started giving them ""real"" names. (like back when they were just gl or whatever).

it was a sedan, nasty, broke down alot, and expensive when it did break. but it was also getting old by that time. back in high school i worked part time at a veterinary clinic, and i remember the owner bought a brand-new gl coupe. 1987 i think. now that sucker was kind of a cool little car."
3292,"March 17, 2006 7:55AM",qbrozen,"so anything major i should be looking at?

i agree that i'd much rather have a stick ... but if this really is that clean, i think the odds of finding a comparable stick with those miles for that price are slim to none.

i've never had a bimmer or even looked at them, so i'm open to any advice.

i'm definitely planning on asking why the engine was rebuilt. could be it was just knocking or smoking. who knows? then again, with only 105k miles, a rebuilt engine doesn't give me much confidence in buying an old bimmer. should i be concerned? do these have a poor history? should i assume its stellar compared to the previously discussed 7-series?

i really think i'm insane for giving up a '98 volvo and buying this .... but at least i'll have money left over for a few repairs."

3294,"March 17, 2006 10:09AM",Mr_Shiftright,"it would be interesting to know what he means by ""rebuilt"" (a much abused term, like ""i love you""). did it fry a head gasket or crack a head...that means bottom end same old thing....

once you find out what was done to the engine (i bet it wasn't ""rebuilt"" but rather ""overhauled""), find out who did it and talk to them.

nice looking car, but if you lose the engine that's it---wrecking yard....otherwise, you can just have the car checked for $100 bucks and see what's up underneath.

check for the usual bmw bugaboos -- do all the ac/heat controls work, all power accessories work...are shocks leaking? any vibration in the driveline when you accelerate (they like to lose u-joints and you can't replace them---you buy a whole new driveshaft and that hurts). also brake rotors are not turnable, so watch for that.

i like the 5 series a lot but if it's had a heart operation i want to know if it was a good surgeon or a home depot job."

3315,"March 18, 2006 1:59PM",andre1969,"the body on that 442 doesn't look too bad. it's probably restorable to someone who wanted one bad enough. but like anything else, you're probably better off just finding one that's in decent shape to begin with.

i looked it up in my auto encyclopedia, and they don't even list a 442 for 1973, so by that time i guess it was downgraded to being an option package, versus a separate model. what the difference is between the two though, is a fine line i guess. anyway, my book lists two 455's available in 1973, a 225 hp version that was standard in the 98 and delta wagons, and optional on other deltas, and a 250 hp version standard on the toronado and optional on the cutlass.

so i'm sure it still had some kick to it, but still kinda underhwhelming compared to the heyday of the musclear era."

http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/oldsmobile-442/oldsmobile-442-history.sh- tml

apparently the 4-4-2 was just a handling and appearance package (with either a 350 or 455), so maybe it is correct, but it looks like a 'home job' to me. in any case, i don't know if it's worth restoring, and the price is so-so (can't you buy the nicest '73 gm anything for $5000?)."

yes, that audi needs the 20v n/a motor to make it remotely interesting, even to me, and i'm into that kinda thing lol. however, i bet its diff locks work unlike the urqs that i am looking at."

3324,"March 18, 2006 8:47PM",lilengineerboy,"i think comparing something that has been the same since 1973 to something that revolutionized world rallying and the all wheel drive sports car concept isn't exactly apples to oranges. also, if you look at any performance attribute, in any weather condition, the audi will lay the smack down on the volvo. if you start looking at faster (turbo) volvos, the costs are more in line with each other. if you want to look at feature content, look at a 760 turbo.
the audi also has a lot more gizmos than the volvo, so there is more to break. price out the cost of rebuilding the rear suspension on a vovlo 760, or replacing the climate control unit, or the power steering components and it will be similar to the audi.
the interiors of both cars fall apart so we will call that a draw."
3325,"March 19, 2006 7:38AM",jrosasmc,"i think you made a good point about both the interiors of the 760 and audi quattro. i remember that they had plastic dashes that would deteriorate rather quickly, fragile wiring harnesses, iffy upholstery, etc.

3326,"March 19, 2006 9:09AM",Mr_Shiftright,"swedish leathers (wherever they got them from) were trash for the longest time...i'm not sure if they were just buying the lower grade or if the way they cured and dyed them was the problem, but they were pretty fragile.

3330,"March 19, 2006 12:15PM",ghulet,"lemme see:

the volvo screams 'bought by rich parents for spoiled high school brat who's now graduated college'. sorry, does that sound bitter? not that it's worth much in 'running' condition, but leaving it to rot over likely a battery is just dumb.

i think that 'chevy' truck is actually a gmc, based on the quad headlights. my grandpa had a '71 chevy pickup, 350 four-barrel, th (i believe), long bed (called 'longhorn'), with metal bed floor (as opposed to the wood floor on my parents lower-line '72 chevy pickup), lasted forever (well, the drivetrain, anyway) and it was seriously fast. tons of torque. looked like the second coming of the truck on 'sanford and son' by the end of its life, though.

that tempest wagon is very cool (natch, made in my birth year), if for no other reason but that i can't remember the last time i saw one. i like the period green, too. i can't compare production numbers off-hand, but it seems like full-size gm wagons of that era have survived (if overpriced) a wee bit, but the intermediates are scarce, if not necessarily valuable."
3331,"March 19, 2006 12:18PM",fintail,"lol i wouldn't expect anyone to chase that triumph. it just has an aura of endless little glitches.

and all of those old chevy trucks were orange and white. when i was in high school a less than beloved old teacher had one of those, it was really minty. orange and white, of course.

biscayne has its own ad now...could be a good beater

another good beater/driver for the price of a service on many cars"
3332,"March 19, 2006 12:23PM",ghulet,"both the biscayne and falcon strike me as bargains, maybe just for the drivetrains (both cheapo four-door sedans with v8s, a bit unusual). they probably don't make the best 'parts cars' for collectible hardtops or convertibles, since most exterior body parts aren't compatible, but both at least look solid.

fwiw, grandpas '71 chevy truck wasn't the 'traditional' (for the era) two-tone orange and white on the body, but it was a kind of copper (body) with white top. didn't think much of it then, wish i had it now, though."
3333,"March 19, 2006 12:39PM",bumpy,"yeah, it's probably a gmc, but those old trucks get parts mixed-n-matched so much that it's a hazardous judgement at this date. they ran th-400s back then. the 'longhorn' option was a 9-foot wideside bed (a regular 8-foot bed with an extension spliced on the front at the factory and fairly rare)."
3334,"March 19, 2006 2:38PM",stickguy,"that biscayne is what everyone keeps asking the domestics to build: a family size, 4 door, v8 rwd sedan, with a stick shift for the purists. just think of it as the 1965 version of the charger, but better since it has a clutch!

also, pardon my ignorance, but what exactly is a protecto-o-plate? i know about the build sheet, etc."
3335,"March 19, 2006 2:39PM",stickguy,"doesn't actually look as bad in the pics as she makes it sound. bring jumper cables and 5-$100 bills, and if it cranks, wave the cash and take it home. if you are reasonably handy (and brave) might get a decent cheap beater. if not, you get it semi-running, and move it to the next sucker for $750!"
3336,"March 19, 2006 3:03PM",lilengineerboy,"hence the disintegrating vovlo interior comment...
it's probably good she moved to nyc where she won't need a car since evidently, she can't take care of one. she did say 2 hundred and something odd thousand miles though. one of my students was complaining she had been given her father's old (8 years) ls400 to take to college so he could get a new one. i offered to trade her the 15 year old non-air conditioned base model civic i had at the time. surprisingly, she refused.
that pontiac wagon was kind of cool. the craigslist around here stinks, although there was an '87 924 up there that sounded like it needed ~$200 to get running (either an ignition module or a fuel pump)."

3344,"March 20, 2006 7:40AM",qbrozen,"so i drove around alot this weekend. stopped at the one place with the 750 and 735 ... turned out it was a junkyard acting like a car lot. took one look at the 735 and got the heck out of there.

stopped at a bunch of places on the way home. stopped in one small lot and spotted a '92 525 with a price of $3500.

went to talk to the owner. his words were ""that's a great car! just had the engine overhauled and the tranny rebuilt. it runs great!"" when i probed into these comments, turns out overhauling the engine amounted to a valve job. oh, and the kicker i did not know until i spoke to him ... it had 203k miles!! well, after he practically begged me to let him start it up to show me how nice, i obliged. let me ask you all ... does a start-stall and then a 2nd start that results in a big cloud of smoke enveloping the car and a final idling tune equivalent to a diesel constitute ""runs great!""???

needless to say, that car was not even a consideration at any price.

now he did have something else on the lot that drew my attention. a '94 mark viii with only 80k miles. the inside wasn't terribly well taken care of, and the body was just so-so, but the engine and undercarriage looked half their age. asking price on this is also $3500. it needed a little love here and there, but that 4.6 is bulletproof, imo, and the low miles probably means i'd get alot of good use out of it. then my wife looked at it and gave it the thumbs down."
3345,"March 20, 2006 7:47AM",british_rover,untill i bought my mini about a year and a half ago all of the cars i had ever bought had been gray just by chance. now all the cars i have bought since the mini have been red and that is by choice. red is my favorite color.
3346,"March 20, 2006 8:55AM",fintail,"this would be one of my last choices for a ""commuter car"", as that idea usually involves reliability

i like blue and silver cars."
3347,"March 20, 2006 9:29AM",andre1969,"but only on certain cars. i think it looks good on small, sporty cars, on old cars, and on cars where there's some kind of accent, like enough chrome or a two-tone color, or convertible top to contrast it. and in most cases, anything with a lot of chrome or two-toning is going to be old, anyway!

another problem with red is that nowadays, the ""true"" red seems to be a rarity. more often than not it's more of an economy-car, orangish-red. at least that c36 appears to be a ""real"" red, but i'm just used to seeing benzes in more ""upscale"" colors, like blues, silvers, blacks, etc. i think red also contrasts better with a true black interior. with dark grays and charcoals, it just looks a bit clashy.

i currently have three red cars. two of them, my desoto and my pickup, are actually two-toned, with a white roof, white lower accent, and enough chrome (well, okay, plastic and aluminum in the truck) to balance it out. the other one, my '76 lemans, was originally a metallic red called ""firethorne"", iirc, but it's been repainted a burgundy."
3348,"March 20, 2006 9:58AM",british_rover,"my mini is red with a black roof, black mirror caps black interior with anthracite accents and soon to be black wheels too.

my jeep is red with gray trim and gray interior.

so yeah i agree red with black looks sharp on smaller cars. on larger vehicles red with tan looks better on the inside. the range rover sport with the red interior looks much better then the one with the black."
3349,"March 20, 2006 10:03AM",fintail,"maybe that's why i like the colors i do, they work better on the cars i like. a red s-class? no way. although a red fintail is kinda cool.

the check engine light sounds like it might be the torque converter not locking up. my buddy's '98 tracker had that problem, except in his case the check engine light would come on and stay on. i remember picking it up from the dealer for him, and finally got about 3 miles away when traffic finally lightened up enough that i got to a high enough speed that the light came on. so back it went. they supposedly fixed it, but as soon as i picked it up, and got up to around 45 mph it did it again. this one had a warranty on it, so it was free, but i'd imagine normally something like that would run a few hundred bucks?

then there's the driver's window. now i could fix a window myself. on something like a 1989 gran fury, 1979 new yorker, 1968 dart, etc. i'd imagine that something like a '91 accord is a bit more complicated, and more expensive when something like that does break.

3383,"March 22, 2006 9:48AM",w9cw,"jrosasmc wrote: ""do you remember the old saab 900s from the '80s? talk about biodegradable interiors!""

yes, i do remember, as i still own two '80s vintage saab 900's that i bought new in 1985 and 1987 respectively. the only interior mateial problem with either is a cracked dash (normal and expected with these cars), and sagging headliners (both replaced by a local auto upholstery shop with exact matching material).

one is a '85 900 8-valve sedan, and the other is a '87 900s 16-valve hatch, both with the cloth interior. the seat material, especially in the '85, show little wear with no tears, etc. overall, they've been good cars, but then again, i perform all maintenance.

most importantly, neither have suffered the bugaboo of head gasket problems. there is a relatively easy fix to ""head off"" (no pun intended) this problem from the ""get go."" only use mercedes-benz coolant (change at every 20k or 2yrs) with distilled water only and change out the temp sensor for the two radiator fans with one from a vw for an earlier activation. result . . . never an overheating problem and never replace a head gasket. both cars have over 175k and the engines are strong as ever, and are used daily. maybe i'll post a photo sometime, i think you would be very impressed with the looks of the '85 900.

i also have a 1970 volvo 144s that was set up for local autocrossing and rallys back in the mid-70s. the interior is perfect, but then it's always been garaged, and not left in the hot sun to bake. the b20b engine only has 98,000 original miles on the clock.

most importantly, swedish iron can be very reliable -- if, and only if, you perform routine maintenace as per the book. otherwise, they die an early death."
3384,"March 22, 2006 10:02AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well the reason your interiors partially held up is that you suffered the dash and headliner problems but you didnt' have leather seats. had you had leather seats, your interior would be totalled just like every other old saab 900 series.

headgasket failure on those cars was calculated at about 10% by saab.net, which is shamefully bad for an automaker imo... and of course the transmissions are very weak.

great bottom end on the engines, though, and great front ends...i'll give credit where it is due....

but you know, maintenance is everything. i'm a maintenance buff of the highest order, but of hundreds of cars i never had more maintenance-hungry cars than saabs and jaguars. even the fiats and alfas weren't as demanding by a long shot.

it's a used car i tell people to avoid, quite frankly...because it requires a special type of owner to have one.

fun to drive though. i was always impressed with handling, except for the convertibles, which are top heavy in the rear end."
3385,"March 22, 2006 10:06AM",bumpy,"a '91 accord with only 129k on the clock runs something like $2500 around here, so if you can patch up one with a crunched nose for less than 2k, it's worth the effort so long as you remember that it's nothing more than a low-mile beater."
3386,"March 22, 2006 10:17AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah but that's a lot of damage to that car! it's a pile of junk. totalled. gone. finito.

hey, let me give you a hard time for a second (for fun) :p do the math here and subtract from the $2,500 value, that's what i did. i don't think the fair market value is a nickel over fifty cents for that car. sure, you can fish for fenders and junkyard parts and have your brother in law paint it on the weekend, blah blah blah, but still the value of the car as it sits shouldn't include free labor and parts scrounging. not everyone can do that, but the general public sets market value, not handymen...er....handypersons....

so that was my reasoning....

new fender (you aren't straightening that one), new bumper, directional body assembly, headlight assembly, hood repair, paint entire hood and fender and splash pan, new front splash pan, window regulator repair, cv joint repair, engine light repair.

total? about $4,000.

just go buy a clean '91 accord. probably no shortages"

i thought the same thing on the transmissions, as i bought both cars from a very small town (600 pop.) dealer in western indiana who had sold saab's only since 1956. he told me going in that the transmissions were weak. but in each case, the original 5-speed manual in the '85 900 and the dreaded, but still original, 3-speed borg-warner automatic in the '87 900s are still going strong. again, maintenance is the key. i've only used synthetic gear lube in the manual since new, and surprisingly the synchros have always worked fine with the synthetic gear lube. and, the type f atf in the automatic is drained and refilled every 20k.

the '85 900 4-door sedan has absolutely no rattles. it is as tight as it was when i drove it off the lot in april 1985. now, the '87 900s 3-door hatchback is another matter. it has its share, but none as signicant as our dodge grand caravan es!"
3388,"March 22, 2006 11:09AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well you know, people fall off buildings now and then and land on mattress trucks...consider yourself lucky to still have an automatic transmission in that car...you are in the minority on that one, good for you. i actually converted my saab to 5-speed after the second automatic failure (good move, by the way, and worth the trouble).

i think the worst rattlers were the coupes and convertibles and the worst head gasket blowers were the turbos. so really the best saab to have imo would be a 900 4-door non turbo."
3389,"March 22, 2006 12:09PM",bumpy,"new? you want to put new parts on a beater?

hood, bumper, fender, headlight off a junkyard accord, don't bother with the grille or splashguard, rebuild the cv joint yourself, tranny and window crud from another junkyard accord, no painting or other silliness: $1000 or less. of course, this is what you do if you don't have or refuse to spend $2500 on that clean accord."

however, the manual steering might be a chore. i've only driven small, lightweight cars with manual steering, so i have no idea how a big, heavy brute would be. i've driven my '68 dart with the power steering disabled, but that's actually worse than a car with nonpower steering would be!

3411,"March 23, 2006 9:19AM",Mr_Shiftright,"corvair is a piece of junk, forget it. restoring a corvair is like restoring old farm equipment. takes a special person to have that much faith.

i've seen the car and it's near flawless (but it is a rubber ducky model).

also keep in mind that these later alfa spiders are dog slow cars. a city bus will mop the floor with you. all the fun is in the top being down and the handsome looks. however, about $3,000 can change all that if your state doesn't have strict smog laws."

reason i'm asking is because the wifey likes the range rovers, and i'm seeing them fairly cheap ($6k for 100k mile examples seems pretty normal), and when i looked up reliability, most reports seem to be pretty favorable."
3417,"March 23, 2006 10:41AM",british_rover,"any range rovers you are seeing for 6,000 dollars are mark ii range rovers which do not use the 7 series motor. a modified version of the 7 series motor was used in 2003-2005 range rovers and it is actually a very good motor. you will never have a drivetrain problem with a new mark iii range unless it is one of the 2003 my cars that has the front diff failure problem.

mark ii ranges use the old fireball v8 developed by oldsmobile in the 50's. it is an ok motor but not particulaly great or that reliable really. oh and if it pukes a motor look at between 7000 and 9000 dollars for a new one.

more likely you will have air suspension problems with those cars and a complete air suspension failure will cost you 3000 and 5000 dollars to fix depending if you want to get new air springs that will fail again in a few years or if you want to retrofit a coil spring suspension."

i think by around 1975 even something like a midsized fury or coronet sedan was around 218"" long. my '79 new yorker is something like 221.3"" long, but somehow those old fuselage c-bodies just seemed so much more massive."
3425,"March 23, 2006 1:12PM",qbrozen,"ah, but, see, i was also thinking its ""only 214""

my lincoln ls, which is not a large car, is 195""

a towncar is 215""

discos use the same motor as the range rover for the most part. 2003 and 2004 discos are actually pretty nice with all up the suspension and braknig updates but they are still very old technology."

in fact, you could argue that it would be safer than a newer car, because since it doesn't have airbags, it would be safe to let the kids ride up front! :p also, let her know that the car has crumple zones, so it's very safe. just don't tell her that the ""crumple zone"" is that whatever that tank hits, it crumples! :surprise:"

3457,"March 27, 2006 7:39AM",british_rover,"yeah i can see that happening for the c36.

i really like the idea of owning a fleet of late model low production/importation vehicles. having a numbered plaque makes it even better but not necessary.

the short lists of the ones i want so far.

1990/1991 lmitsubishi galant vr-4 they only imported 3,009 of these.

2000 holland & holland range rover only 125 of these were imported. scroll about half way down to see the specs.

2002 westminster or rhino edition range rover. 125 rhino edition range rovers were imported and 300 westminster editon vehicles.

i wouldn't mind having a 2006 edition westminster range rover but at almost a 100,000 dollars they are a little out of my price range.

2006 subaru legacy gt spec b i know what you are gonna say, ""its a subaru what are you thinking?"" they only impored 500 and it does have the numbered plaque. we have a subaru store in our dealer group so i got a chance to drive one and i must say for the money one of the better sports sedans i have driven. i really like the brick red leather too."
3458,"March 27, 2006 8:51AM",fintail,"cheapie roadster

i like having a modern low production car too. unfortunately, my insurance company also knows it is an unusual car.

i saw an odd range rover this weekend...it was the older kind, yellow, with some kind of smallish emblem on the door. was this any kind of limited edition?"
3459,"March 27, 2006 9:12AM",british_rover,"it was probably a borrego edition range rover. i have never actually seen one in person. they were all borrego yellow yellow in color, same yellow as se3 freelanders were offered in, with some special interior stuff.

check here just scroll down to special editions.

there were a ton of special edition range rovers during the 2002 model year since it was the last year of that body style and they were filling in production gaps before the retool."
3460,"March 27, 2006 9:20AM",fintail,"maybe that was it. i swear it sat kind of different and had some kind of emblem on the door, but i saw it in traffic, so that might warp my perception. rrs are fairly popular in my neck of the woods, as well as lrs - there's a current model rr, a lr3, and about 3 discos in the parking garage of my apartment building alone. maybe some special editions made it here too."
3461,"March 27, 2006 9:53AM",british_rover,"i think, although i am not sure, that the import numbers for special edition cars are for the us and canada combined.

if it was a mark ii body range and it was in yellow then it had to be a the borego edition one cause i think that was the only time they offered that color in the range rover."
3462,"March 27, 2006 9:59AM",Mr_Shiftright,"older amg models have historically tanked big time in value in america, partly because the old ones were ugly ""boy racer"" cars and partly because people are shy of modified luxury cars that they can't get fixed easily. we'll see what happens with the new gen, which are more attractive and less pretentious styling-wise. they will always be saleable but the question is at what price. i don't ever see them bringing back their original msrps for a long, long time, maybe never."

3464,"March 27, 2006 10:32AM",fintail,"i wouldn't expect actual real investment potential out of any of these cars, certainly not a return to msrp - i mean, my c43 stickered at around 57k back in 1998! and a loaded s65 today will be like 180k+. you just can't win with that. but i at least like to think there will be demand enough to avoid depreciation to nothing. i mean, 126s are still depreciating, and it's kinda sad."
3465,"March 27, 2006 10:40AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well you're right, no car that has serious hp will ever depreciate to nothing...but the term ""collectible"" suggests to me mobs of people in a bidding frenzy and drunk with lust...i don't see that for these cars...."

can't remember the last time i saw one of these:

http://chicago.craigslist.org/car/145678715.html

i'm sure this was snapped up instantly, not only for the price but for the highly unusual rust-free old body. i remember what a sensation these cars were when new, though they seem underwhelming in most respects now. heavy, a bit thirsty, equipped with automatics probably half the time, but i guess glamorous anyway. i love that it's at least original, though needing an engine or at least a rebuild (is that possible?)."

3472,"March 28, 2006 8:23AM",andre1969,"from a few posts back. reminds me of the old '69 bonneville 4-door hardtop i used to have. even though that car went through starters like they were chinese food (eats one and then before too long it's hungry again!) and got all beat-up in the hands of my cousin, who owned it before me, i still kinda wish i had it.

it had a 400-4bbl which i think had 350 hp in that setup, but not positive. it was pretty fast though...when it wasn't eating starters! it was also a surprisingly well-handling car, considering its bulk. i guess ""wide track"" really meant something back then!"
3473,"March 28, 2006 9:47AM",Mr_Shiftright,"geez---who'd want that old supra? it needs paint and an engine, so you're buried for life in it(and the next life, too). i don't get it. well maybe they would just gut it and make some kind of retro-rod out of it.....

this is a $2,000 car clean and running, with all the power and handling of a corolla.

maybe they think it's a 90s twin turbo or something?"
3474,"March 28, 2006 10:56AM",fintail,"i'm kind of ashamed to admit i almost like that supra too.

when i was in high school, ca. 1994 an acquaintance got a pristine 1980 supra from his grandma or great aunt or something. it was in new condition, kind of an off-white. it had like 50k miles on it iirc. i remember even at the time noticing that it was kind of an obscure car. i thought it was pretty cool in its own way...but being in the hands of a dumb kid, the wear piled on fast."
3475,"March 28, 2006 11:09AM",andre1969,"one of the other drivers had a celica hatchback. i want to say it was a 1981. it was primer gray, pretty rusty, and pretty nasty in general. his girlfriend also worked there for awhile, and she drove a beat-up early 80's chevy pickup, also in multiple shades of primer. i guess that was their color of choice! :p

still, that celica could have been a cool car if it was in nicer shape. oh, and count me in as one who also likes those circa 1980 supras. when i was a kid and would see one occasionally, i used to think they were something mildy exotic."

3480,"March 28, 2006 2:05PM",andre1969,"the '63 is one of my favorite fords of the '60's, followed closely by the '65-66, and then maybe the '67.

we had a '64 ford galaxie 500 sedan when i was a little kid, and i didn't like it. in fact, i think i hated it, but my dad hated fords, so he probably taught me to hate it! even today though, i don't really care for the '64 ford, even though it's not that different from the '63. i just think that in '63 they got all the details just right on that body style.

i have a cousin down in southern va who has an old galaxie 4-door hardtop, but i can't remember if it's a '61 or '62. i think it's black with a dark red top and red interior. been ages since i've been down that way, and it seems like nowadays the only time we see that side of the family is whenever someone dies."
3481,"March 28, 2006 2:08PM",british_rover,"a couple of years ago there was a very similar car to that galaxie down the street from me but in white with a new top and new transmission. the interior was pretty much perfect and the painted only needed minor touch up in a few areas. i think the guy wanted 5,500 for it so yeah i agree that one is overpriced."
3482,"March 28, 2006 2:42PM",fintail,"lol it's really just all coincidental! maybe they were really popular in the nw back in the day or something. most 63-64 chevys i see around here are pretty rotten, and mopars from that era are rarely seen, but there are lots of 65-68 models lurking around."

3484,"March 29, 2006 7:25AM",andre1969,"if those wasp-waisted ""x""-frames that the chevies used up through 1964 made the cars more prone to rusting than fords, which used a more conventional frame. i can't remember if the fords used a perimeter frame or a ladder frame, though.

the x-frame made the chevy more vulnerable in a side impact, and since it naturally would have made the car more prone to twisting, they had to shore up the sides of the car. however, the way they did it wasn't as sturdy as if they just had a frame up under there in the first place, so it may have been more prone to rust-out.

i've heard that those x-frame cars were sometimes considered to be a cross between body-on-frame and unitized. not completely one type, but not completely the other, either.

iirc, the '59-64 buick also used an x-frame, but i think the '59-64 olds and pontiac used a more modern perimeter frame."
3485,"March 29, 2006 10:06AM",fintail,"this is a shame as it looks pretty nice...hopefully it will become a good parts car or a recipient of a good engine, and not become a franken-benz

3486,"March 29, 2006 10:28AM",fintail,"that might be it. i've seen several ratty 63-64 chevys over the past couple years, and the similar fords i've seen just seem more solid. i'm sure they do rust well themselves, though, it seems everything from that time does."
3487,"March 29, 2006 10:49AM",andre1969,"that's not going to have anything to do with how fast sheetmetal rusts out...stuff like the quarter panels, rockers, lower edges of the door, around the headlights, etc, so i guess an old ford or perimeter frame gm car from that era could start looking bad just as fast. but with the chevies, i think the real structural damage might start quicker, so that they get removed from service sooner.

oddly, most of the mopars i see from that era that haven't been restored don't seem too bad with respect to rust. especially considering that they were untized from 1960 onward. i wonder if it's because the '57-59 models rusted so badly and got such a bad rap, that chrysler was actually forced to improve their rust resistance?

i don't know if this is true or not, but i've heard that gm tended to roll their sheetmetal thinner in those days. i don't know about the early 60's, but judging from my '68 dart compared to my '67 catalina, the dart definitely feels like it has thicker sheetmetal to me."
3488,"March 29, 2006 1:37PM",fintail,"aah, i don't know so much about body-on-frame cars, i've never dealt with them in great detail. i figured the parts of the body not near the frame might somehow be more likely to rust.

maybe the fords just had more conservative owners than the chevies which always seemed to end up in the hands of racers and car abusers."

3500,"March 31, 2006 6:54PM",fintail,"if you like fixing your car a lot, this is for you

nice looking (well, nice condition) 70s survivor"
3501,"April 1, 2006 9:53AM",Mr_Shiftright,yeah but think about pumping $3 a gallon premium fuel every 8 or 9 miles. this is not a pretty picture. you're lookin' at .30 to .35 cents a mile to go anywhere!
3502,"April 1, 2006 10:53AM",fintail,"in size/weight per dollar, this wins"
3503,"April 1, 2006 5:34PM",fintail,"great colors, but probably a little steep"
3504,"April 2, 2006 5:56PM",british_rover,"looks in good shape.

i have always liked that color on the z's as well.

the other end of the spectrum

better then putting a chevy small block in it

looks pretty good as well

poor baby

looks fairly good for the price"
3505,"April 2, 2006 6:09PM",fintail,"i kinda like that one with the modern engine

i suspect these were less than reliable"
3506,"April 2, 2006 6:17PM",british_rover,"one particular business i would like to start would be a shop that takes classic vehicles and then restores them with modern engines and suspension. not necessarily the typical resto mod place though. the outside of the car would be kept strictly stock except for modern tires. whatever the closest modern equivelant of its original engine would be used as well.

for the z car although a sr20det is a good choice it would be better to use a skyline 6 clyinder motor and 6 speed tranny."
3507,"April 2, 2006 7:02PM",fintail,i've thought about that kinda thing too. a lot of old mb could be improved with the m103 6cyl as found in the original 300e. and i am sure many 30s-40s cars have plenty of room to adapt new suspensions and engines while looking stock.
3508,"April 3, 2006 5:58AM",bumpy,"for the z car although a sr20det is a good choice it would be better to use a skyline 6 clyinder motor and 6 speed tranny.

except that the rb and a six-gun will be about 200 pounds heavier than the sr20 and a silvia 5-speed (which is good for about 400 hp), so unless you're doing a full gt-r swap the rb really isn't worth the trouble."
3509,"April 3, 2006 6:21AM",british_rover,i meant better in the terms of sticking with the evolution of the model by choosing the 6 cylinder rb and 6 speed tranny. it would of course be more costly and demanding from an engineering stand point.
3510,"April 3, 2006 10:19AM",Mr_Shiftright,"there are quite a few businesses like this already in operation---but it requires that you do this to very high demand and potentially valuable cars.

the conversions i've seen center around these types of cars:

jaguar 3.8 mark ii sedans getting modern jaguar drivetrains with (gasp!) toyota transmissions

50s chevrolets getting f.i. engines, disk brakes, o/d transmissions or 5 speeds, etc.

ditto with old chevy pickup trucks

vw westphalia vans converted to jetta turbo diesel engines

i don't think you could make money doing this kind of thing on japanese cars or benz sedans however. too much $$ for cars worth too little is the problem...."
3511,"April 3, 2006 11:11AM",andre1969,"there was an outfit that was buying salvageable mid-60's gm intermediate convertibles, such as cutlasses, tempests, etc, and refurbishing and modernizing them. they tried to make them look as stock as possible on the outside, although they would turn these more plebian convertibles into wanna-be musclecars, putting 4-4-2 badges on the olds models, gto badges on the tempests, etc.

mechanically, they'd put power disc brakes up front, and under the hood a fairly mild crate chevy 350 would be installed. i forget the tranny though. either a thm350 or that 4-speed automatic, which i think is called a 4l60e?

i can't remember if the cars were fuel injected or had 4-bbl carbs. this was around 1990 or so, so it was before the lt-1 350 that went in the caprice, impala ss, etc, but it still had more power than the 185 tbi copcar 350.

they sold them for around $25,000 new, which was still considered a lot of money back then. i don't know how long this company lasted, or if they're still around. one of those buff rags did a test of a '67 cutlass ""4-4-2"" convertible version. it wasn't mt or c&d though. i want to say it was ""automobile""?

i think the company also modded one mopar, like a charger, as a special request, but as a rule didn't like to mess with intermediate mopars or fords of that era, because their unitized construction made them harder to restore."
3512,"April 3, 2006 12:26PM",Mr_Shiftright,ohhhh...the 4l60e is not such a good transmission. that could have been a fatal choice.
3513,"April 3, 2006 12:46PM",fintail,"i can't see how people in england pay such huge sums for those vicarage etc renovated mkiis. they cost a princely sum when freshly rebuilt. if i had a huge lottery jackpot etc i'd start a shop that renovated old mb like that. not for profit, but for fun. fintails and 108/109s with m103 engines would be pretty nice. i'm sure i'd have a small following anyway."
3514,"April 3, 2006 2:36PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well it's because the jaguar mkiis are such beautiful cars, and very luxurious inside. the mbs of those days seem very spartan in comparison. so i think the modern temperment finds the mkii more in keeping with ""looking like as much as it costs"". ditto 50s and 60s american cars---they have charisma and (most of them anyway) good looks in a flashy kind of way. a benz looks wrong if you try to glitz it up with chrome and wire wheels, etc. doesn't work.

the westphalia conversions are strictly pragmatic, and people will pay up to $15,000 to trick them out with a turbo diesel. in this modernized form, they made very trendy ""retro-campers"" that you can actually use.

so i think this modernization trend needs a big payoff to work."
3515,"April 3, 2006 6:21PM",fintail,"yeah, mbs are cursed that way...it probably costs the same to restore a fintail/108 as a mkii or late 50s american car, but the payoff is much more for the non-mb. but there might be some interest among a small niche anyway, not saying that it would be profitable or sustainable. i guess i am not looking at it from a profit standpoint, but a fun standpoint. it's hard to profit with most old cars to begin with, and just about impossible with any closed mb. i could probably sink 25k into my fintail and be lucky to get 10k out of it."
3516,"April 3, 2006 6:52PM",fintail,"oh, and on the mb note, my old mb specialist recently picked up one of his dream cars, a mint 116 diesel. this is a 79 300sd, one local owner, apparently completely as-new. i've never really liked 116s, but i'd take one like his. in the mb world, this is a disco-mobile, but it sure is handsome in this color and condition. he's done a vegetable oil conversion on it too."
3517,"April 3, 2006 8:05PM",Mr_Shiftright,"looks good. a friend of mine has a diesel wagon for sale...he'll probably get around $3,500 for it. it's in pretty good shape but it's been ""dogified"" by his mangy mutt, so i don't know if a good detailing can save that interior.

now then, a diesel wagon might be a good car for modification--- a corvette c5 driveline with a 6 speed manual transmission would be great! then you'd have a tank like body, plenty of power and probably fuel mileage equal to the original diesel motor."
3518,"April 3, 2006 8:13PM",jrosasmc,is the gm 4l60-e transmission a weak unit? or is there something in the electronic controls that causes it to malfunction?
3519,"April 3, 2006 9:44PM",fintail,"there seems to be some kind of pent up demand for those wagons - good ones seem to bring decent money. i know of a really immaculate 85 that brought $7500, and i've seen crazy money as asking prices for them in hemmings.

yeah, that would be a good basis for a mod car, too. leave all the original badging on it, of course. you'd have to be able to have fun with it now and then."
3520,"April 4, 2006 5:19AM",andre1969,"well, i don't know if this is a sign, but the 4l60-e tranny in my uncle's '97 silverado just had to be rebuilt, at around the 110,000 mile mark. and to add insult to injury, this is the second time it's been redone!

i forget exactly when the first time was, but i think it was around the 70,000 mile mark, and it was covered by an extended warranty that time. iirc, the dealer had his truck for about a month fixing that danged thing. in contrast, the local transmission shop, who services my cars and rebuilt a '79 newport tranny for me years ago, did it in about 2 days.

oh, and there was a similar-vintage suburban in there, also getting its tranny rebuilt! same unit, too. i had thought the 4l60-e was mainly just a v-6 truck tranny, but evidently it goes up behind v-8's, too. i guess you have to get a 3/4 ton or bigger truck, or a stronger v-8, before you get the 4l80-e?

as for what failed on the tranny, the way the guy at the shop explained it, reverse commonly goes out, and then that takes out second and overdrive, leaving just first and third (the 1:1 drive)"
3521,"April 4, 2006 7:13AM",british_rover,"about this jag?

i mean i know it would be a nightmare but if you happend to have one and needed parts i guess it would be good."
3522,"April 4, 2006 8:00AM",qbrozen,"interesting find.

its about the least desirable e-type (i like how he calls it an x-type, by the way), but it does have the v12 and manual tranny, which helps the value.

i don't know much, but i don't see why this wouldn't be a worthwhile project since everything from the windshield back seems to be in good shape. you never know what is underneath, though, so i definitely wouldn't buy sight unseen."
3523,"April 4, 2006 8:22AM",british_rover,"yeah i noticed the x-type thing as well when that is clearly an e-type. i am guessing they do not know much about jags. someone with the resources could probably steal it and get it back into shape with a minimal, relative to how much troubles jags usually are, amount of trouble."
3524,"April 4, 2006 8:24AM",british_rover,"is this a nomad?

i always liked the biscayne."
3525,"April 4, 2006 9:30AM",fintail,"kind of an automotive black hole

crackhead of the day winner

""95% unmolested"" - is that a good thing?"
3526,"April 4, 2006 9:47AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i don't think so. these cars are devils to work on and the front end damage alone makes the car a wrecking yard special. also, bad color, shabby interior, wrong model and horrible engine.

frankly, someone would be certifiably nuts to try and fix this car. you can buy a really nice one of these for $30,000. money pit, don't go there, ever.

but parts? a goldmine!"
3527,"April 4, 2006 9:48AM",andre1969,"because it's such a pretty automotive black hole.

in a twisted way, i kinda like that marlin, although i think i'd just rather have the classic hardtop, or whatever they called the style that first marlin was based on."
3528,"April 4, 2006 9:49AM",british_rover,ok that is what i was really wondering. trying to actually restore that thing might not be any good but if you could steal it for a fairly low amount of money then you could part it out and make your money back a couple of times over probably.
3529,"April 4, 2006 9:56AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well unfortunately if the car can't be made to run, your parts goldmine goes up in smoke. the most valuable part of that car, the front end clip that goes up and down, is ruined, so that's maybe $3,000---$4,000 down the drain. if you can't make it run you can't sell the engine, and you can't test the transmission.

the engine and transmission on this car must come out together (that's 1,400 lbs of it) and it must come out the bottom of the car....are you getting the picture?

and with a ruined interior, really what have we got here? glass, misc. small parts, alternator, starter, wheels, etc.

you can't even get the rear brake calipers off without dropping the rear end axle assembly.

it's not looking so good, is it?"
3530,"April 4, 2006 10:05AM",andre1969,"maybe they could end up using it as the ""football"" in some of those demolition derby games. it would be more interesting than the b210 or chevette or metro that would otherwise get used! :p"
3531,"April 4, 2006 10:28AM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh, i love demo derbies. i'm going to one in watsonville calif in june. it's been a while.

actually the best thing to do with that jag is cut the rear clip off to get a rear-ended sister ship in better condition back on the road.

unless that model of e type starts selling for about $100k a pop, it's doomed i think."

3538,"April 5, 2006 8:04AM",andre1969,"i kinda like that one. not too crazy about the color, but it looks like a nice, clean ride. back in 1996 i came kinda close to buying a '76 newport. it was a silver 4-door hardtop with a burgundy interior/roof, and a 440 v-8. it was at a park-and-sell lot. i was interested, until i looked underneath and noticed most of the exhaust system was missing. plus the rear quarter panels were rotted out (hard to spot at first because of the way they wrap under). then there was the fuel leak... :surprise:"

and that's kinda what they did with this newport...it had these frame rails that connected the front and rear subframes."

then again, here's its 35 year-old equivalent, and if it gets the money he's asking, perhaps we're all wrong:

http://chicago.craigslist.org/car/149664396.html

not sure where the 'clean car' description comes from (does that mean it was washed recently?), i don't see a straight, rust free panel with original paint in that picture. i don't care if it has 35k or not, if this car gets half that asking price, i'll buy up every ratty nova i see from now on! i think these were going for about fifty bucks when i was in high school."
3549,"April 9, 2006 1:29PM",Mr_Shiftright,somebody make make a street rod out of it if the body were really sound and good. it would be a good builder.
3550,"April 9, 2006 1:58PM",gsemike,"that's a 6 cyl car. the typical small block build up is worth 10 grand to 12 grand. that's a car with a decent paint job, at least a grand in rims and tires, a rebuilt 350 with the usual goodies and buckets and console with a gauge package.

who cares if it's got 35k on it? the drivetrain's got to go to make it at all interesting. that's obviously not the original paint so who knows what it's like underneath and who really knows if it's got 35, 135 or 235?

i'm thinking 2 grand.. maybe 2500."
3551,"April 9, 2006 4:04PM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah but nobody gets his money out of a street rod anyway, and mechanical work is a lot easier than body work."

oh, and the '81-83 malibu hubcaps set it off nicely

i think i'd definitely be fool enough to plunk down $4900 for that '70 grand marquis, before i'd throw down $5k for that nova! for the most part, i never really liked big mercs beyond around 1963, but that style that ran from around '69-72, with the hidden headlights and grilles that hadn't gotten too tall yet, always appealed to me."

3559,"April 10, 2006 10:17AM",Mr_Shiftright,"makes me want to publish the selling prices of b-j cars three months after the auction, when 95% of the buyers find out they paid 30% over market value."
3560,"April 10, 2006 10:27AM",andre1969,"this little magazine of theirs was a real hoot. one of the articles in there was ""the top 5 barret jackson myths"" or something to that tune. one of the myths was that if you tip the auctioneer, you'll get a higher price. one i really loved though, was the myth that people over-pay for b-j cars. they responded to that by saying that the only amount a winner overpays is by how much he beat the #2 bidder by!

ummm, okay. :confuse:

oh, and they were trying to push the whole ""b-j experience"", attempting to pass it off as a lifestyle and a privileged experience that you really can't place a dollar value on. and oh, the lifelong pals you'll make.

umm, yeah, go try telling the wife that you want to hang out with your bj buddies on sunday afternoon, and see what she thinks of it! :p"
3561,"April 10, 2006 10:32AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well if they are implying that b-j ""sets the market price"" that's simply a lot of hot air. if they are saying ""the car was worth that much to that person on that day"", i have no argument with that.

again, the old rule applies...unless you eyeball the car up close and personal, you can't say precisely what a particular car is worth. digital camera photos don't cut it---i have seen so many ebay cars that look great in photos and then you see it and it's appaling how badly it was represented. on the other hand, i've seen what i thought were ""overpriced"" cars from b-j and they were so perfect and spectacular and correct that i realized that even at the inflated selling price, the restorer couldn't have come out very well.

aside from the very rare cars, where the argument is ""pay this price because where can you find another one?"" (a very good argument for an inflated price, by the way)...but aside from those cars, i think the others are overpriced, even if they are very nice.....because one sale is a database of one, and that's all....."
3562,"April 10, 2006 10:39AM",qbrozen,"here's the thing, though .... they aren't overpaying as long as people keep flocking to bj. there were many instances over the past couple of years where they have made a comment like ""oh, this one went through last year."" so there are quite a few vehicles that are simply being bought and sold ... like stocks. and, so far, the prices keep going up as bj gains in popularity each year. i won't argue that they are overpaying ... but then someone just overpays even more the next year. so bj may not be market correct in all of car-dom ... but they are market correct if you consider bj in a vacuum-like market all by itself."
3563,"April 10, 2006 10:43AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i seriously doubt more than a small fraction of previously bought b-j cars bring higher prices each year...it's a narrow market within a narrow market that you're seeing...the rare and unusual cars within the unusual b-j climate....how can most people be making a profit when both buyers and sellers are paying commissions to b-j and expecting to beat inflation and a profit on top of that? if you added up say 15% to b-j from both sides + 2% inflation, and if you sold the car at a 20% jump in price in one year, the car itself cleared only 3% in a year.

it's smoke and mirrors, folks, except for the lucky few who buy rare and correct cars. and remember, cars that were selling for 10 million in 1989 were selling for 1.5 million in 1991."
3564,"April 10, 2006 10:54AM",qbrozen,"if we wanted to spend the time, we may be able to contruct a list from the info on their website .... but i ain't doin it.

i'm sure you're right about the smoke and mirrors. i mean, once you deduct all the commission, entry fees, transportation, etc, etc ... its way more than just the selling price dictates. which certainly makes me wonder why cars return the next year. maybe the new owner sobered up later and realized they need to recoup what they can, and bj is the only place they can hope someone will pay more than they did.

or, maybe they just have so much money that they want to have it for a year and then exchange it the next year for something different. if the cars were considerably cheaper, and i had considerably more disposable income, i could see myself doing this."
3565,"April 10, 2006 11:03AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah a lot of auction buys are impulse buys and people quickly tire of their purchases. it's an affluent man's version of some women buying clothes that they hang up in the closet with the price tags still on them. i run into guys who bought on impulse all the time and then get home with that 1967 lincoln continental convertible that still needs $4,000 worth of work that went unnoticed ""under the lights"" and they're scratchin' their heads wondering...now why exactly did i buy this car? oh, it seemed like a good deal at the time (before i checked the market value)."
3566,"April 10, 2006 11:09AM",andre1969,"is a 1977.5 can am that recently sold in a b-j auction for something like $23,000. now it was very low mileage, iirc, so if you want a low-mileage, really nice can am, you probably won't be able to find another.

speaking of low-mileage cars, what exactly do most people do with them? i have a buddy who bought a 1978 mark v last year that only had around 11,000 miles on it. i'm sure he paid a premium because of those low miles. but he does drive it regularly to car shows and such.

i think with him though, he was trying to rationalize it as buying an almost-new 1978 car that still has a ton of life left. but not taking into account that things are still going to deteriorate, break, short out, etc, simply from old age. and going to the beach one day last year, that's exactly what happened...his a/c compressor seized up and sent smoke billowing out from under the hood. he thought it was on fire, so he pulled off to the side of the highway and called the fire dept from his cell phone."
3567,"April 10, 2006 11:12AM",Mr_Shiftright,"there you go, the elegant trap of old cars with very low miles....if you drive them, they depreciate in value as the miles go up...if you don't drive them, why'd you buy it---especially if it isn't particulary special to begin with."
3568,"April 10, 2006 3:39PM",fintail,"so which digit in the price was added by accident?

dude thinks he has a shelby or something"

3571,"April 11, 2006 10:06AM",andre1969,"the thm200r4 tranny as far as durability goes? i know it's based on the lightweight thm200c that was known for early failure, but i heard they got most of the kinks out of the 200r4 fairly early on.

i've had two cars with them...an '85 lesabre that we had to 157,000 miles and an '86 monte that made it to 192,000 when it got t-boned. both cars were bought new by family members, and never had a bit of transmission trouble. however, in both cases, they were also paired up to fairly mild engines...a 307 with 140 hp/255 ft-lb of torque and a 305 with 150 hp/245 ft-lb.

i know there was a beefed-up version that was used in the grand national, monte carlo supersport, and the cutlass 4-4-2/hurst.

with the exception of the weak olds diesel though, i don't think the 200r4 was ever paired up with an engine in the 5.7 liter range. would it be strong enough for those beefier engines? once gm started using 350's in their big cars again (i think starting in 1990 for the brougham), those used a tranny called the thm700r4, or something to that tune. i dunno what police cars would have used though, in that interim period between when the thm350 went out, and before the thm700 became available.

how would a 200r4 compare to a 4l60e tranny?"

3573,"April 11, 2006 6:30PM",ghulet,"never liked falcons much, i'm definitely into the larger, glitzier, guzzlier of '60s cars. have to admit they made a lot of sense, though. apparently there were plenty of people who didn't particularly like the trade-off of cars that got 9 mpg, cost $4-5k and took up an entire garage just to get to work or the store and to haul six people once in a while.

i like that galaxie, i'm partial to four-door hardtops in general, though. i like the gms of that year better, though they're a big, bulbous mess compared to the cleaner, boxier lines of the fords. that upright roofline really emphasizes the length of the trunk on that galaxie, though. its proportions aren't quite right, imo."
3574,"April 11, 2006 7:16PM",fintail,"it's more of a notchback hardtop rather than the pseudo-fastback style that gm used, so that trunk does look big...and it is big!

3576,"April 12, 2006 5:25AM",andre1969,"i think my favorites are the '62-63. i like their curved, rounded style, and in '62-63 you could get a hardtop and convertible. the '60-61 were mainly just cheap, basic transportation though, with no hardtops or 'verts, and i just didn't care for the way they boxed up the sheetmetal for '64-65. then in '66, even though it was still considered a compact, the falcon actually got moved to the intermediate platform. they chopped about 8 inches out of the wheelbase and also, pardon the pun, trunk-ated it, to make it smaller than a fairlane.

also, by '66, ford was trying to concentrate on the mustang as its sporty small offering, so all the desirable styles of falcon, like the hardtops and convertibles, were dropped.

the main thing that's always scared me about the falcon though, is that they look like they'd blow up in the slightest of rear-enders. ever look up underneath one? there's not really much to them, and the drop-in gas tank (where the top of the tank also serves as the trunk floor) looks like it's about two inches from the rear bumper. i always wondered how explosion-proof a falcon is, compared to a pinto.

i always loved the style of those big '65-67 fords. and like you, ghulet, i've always been a big fan of the 4-door hardtop. i think the big gm 4-door hardtops looked great in '65-66, but didn't like them as much when they went swoopy for '67."

sounds exactly the same as the '66 stang i had. and, yeah, i worried about that design as well. i never did get that car on the road, though, so i never had to find out how it would fare getting rear-ended."

lots of neat stuff was posted... that fiat/beretone x19 is an inexpensive mid-engined sports car. i think i would be tempted to look for a first gen mr2 first due to reliability issues. x1/9s are great for auto-x though, and yugo hop up parts and aftermarket support is there.
1990-1996 300zx aged so gracefully. the 2+2 is the ugly duckling but the 2 seater turbo or non are both great rides. the turbo has superhicas 4 wheel steering which didn't age quite so gracefully, but eliminators are available as well as the repair parts.
svt focus-not really much of anything. about the same money as an srt-4 which actually has a limited slip diff and enough power to be embarrassing to expensive stuff. what svt meant to do was give us the st200, but ford wussed out and now no more svt.
dsms-i think i would go for a galant vr-4, but they all have the same problems. ya gotta be a little gentle with the trans or it won't like 200+ hp. if you turn up the boost, you blow a hg (thats nothing new with turbo cars). the later ones have a ""crank walk"" issue, so actually these earlier blocks are better.
that 2002 looks great. if i had 7gs burning a whole in my pocket i'd be all over that. i actually think i would rather have one in slightly worse shape, and a base not a tii, and then swap a 90s 318i motor and trans in it.

as for evidence to how popular those buttoned seats were, well here's an anectode. you could get seats like that on the 1979 chrysler new yorker, but on the fifth avenue, which was about $1500 more expensive, you got a different seat pattern that was sleeker, more modern looking, and less pimpy. alas, people wanted the pimpier seats, so eventually chrysler just switched it. you got the sleeker seats with the regular nyer, and the pimpy seats with the 5th avenue! when they went on the m-body platform for 1982, it was pimpy buttoned seats, all the way!

oh, here's something you don't see too often anymore, at least not in good shape. i know these early preludes were supposed to be sporty cars, but i always looked at them as honda's interpretation of the monte carlo/cordoba concept. basically a luxurious car with formal, ""important"" styling, based on an everyday family car. just instead of an intermediate, it was based on a subcompact.

also, are my eyes deceiving me or does this prelude have leather seats? at a quick glance it actually doesn't look bad, but in the close shots, rust has taken its toll."
3638,"April 20, 2006 9:22AM",qbrozen,"yes.... sort of. there was a time when they deemed seatbelts too expensive. that doesn't mean it was a good reason not to put them in.

i thought you were implying it wasn't a good idea just because only 1 manufacturer ever did it (and, actually, others have done it ... just not in volume)."
3639,"April 20, 2006 9:25AM",qbrozen,one word on that prelude .... automatic! ugh.
3640,"April 20, 2006 10:02AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i never heard of another stainless steel-bodied production car, but i have heard of railroad car bodies using stainless. maybe johnny z should have listened to 100 years of collective auto building wisdom.

for some reason the delorean bodies were very susceptible to getting marked up and stained. if you didn't keep after it constantly, the finish looked like crap...even leaning against it while wearing levis reportedly left an imprint of the pants pocket on the car (so claims one car magazine).

any any rate, the finish of the bodies are the least of the delorean's many problems."
3641,"April 20, 2006 10:13AM",lemko,"shoot, i love that eldo! the 4100 engine, however, scares me off. love those seats! my 1985 chrysler fifth avenue had seats like those!

as for that eldorado, even though i was defending cadillac's reason for making those types of seats (because that's what the people wanted), i personally don't like them that much. i always preferred the interior and seats of the toronado and riviera from that timeframe, which seemed much more understated and classy. one thing i also remember about those eldo seats is that the leather was kind of thick and hard, with very little give. it wasn't soft and cushy, the kind you just sink into and get coddled, like the pimpy new yorker seats, or even the older '71-78 eldorado seats.

oh, i really like that '76 caprice. i think i could see andre in it, too! :shades: i hope it at least has a 350 in it though. i think by this time a 305 was actually standard."

otherwise, it's the same color (puce, i think it was called), both have the 350 with the 3 speed auto and dual exhaust, the sticker inside the glove box door outlining all the options (which my sister marked up with crayon not long after we bought it), and, most importantly, dad's truck is a one owner vehicle that has been recently restored to like new condition.

i know that dad turned down an offer of $8500 before the restoration was started .. i think it cost him somewhere around $5-6k when the restore was all said and done. i wonder how much it might be worth."

3674,"April 24, 2006 10:23AM",Mr_Shiftright,"saw a really good man-trap of a car yesterday.

it was a 1980 porsche targa for sale. very clean car, 200k on engine, asking price $10,000, which is about right given the mileage, maybe a bit low.

i noticed an oil leak in the rear of the engine, with a fairly large puddle on the ground (size of a beer coaster).

seller: ""oh, that a seal behind the pulley. you just take off the pulley and maybe lower the engine a bit and punch in a new seal"".

oh yeah? in fact, that's called a ""nose cone seal"" and while it's true it's just an o-ring gone bad, the bad news is that you have to split the engine case to replace it (no other way to access it, sorry).

so in fact, this $10,000 car is really a $2,000 car at best, because when you break down a 200k porsche engine you'd be pretty crazy not to rebuild it after splitting the case....and that costs $12,000.

given that a really sharp '80 targa with a rebuilt engine should sell at about $15,000, what we have here is a parts car.

when it comes to old porsches, buyer beware x 2."
3675,"April 24, 2006 10:28AM",lemmer,"nice rx-7 but i suspect the price is a little high. i like the simplicity of this particular one. it doesn't even have alloy wheels. this guy gets some amazingly original cars from around this time, but they are usually something more like an '82 caprice.

decent mgb but something seems a little odd about it - maybe i am not used to seeing steel wheels on bs."
3676,"April 24, 2006 10:31AM",lemmer,"buying the car for $2000, could i just squirt silicon all over it, buy lots of oil, and drive it for a year?

did the guy drop his price when you informed him of the necessary repair?"
3677,"April 24, 2006 10:34AM",qbrozen,"thank god he's asking the moon on that rx7. if it was a no reserve auction, i'd be begging the wife rather than typing this."
3678,"April 24, 2006 10:39AM",fintail,"that white rx7 looks exactly like the car the people across the street from us had when i was in kindergarten or so...i loved that car, i'd look at it a lot and they had kids, so i'd go along with them in it whenever i could."
3679,"April 24, 2006 10:44AM",Mr_Shiftright,"nope, the oil leak will just get worse and worse. the seal (and the collar it goes around) are inside the engine. you can't goop it or even talk to it.

the seller actually got mad at me for telling him and said i didn't know what i was talking about. i love it when people say that, since my friend was with me who has been rebuilding porsche engines and racing them for 25 years and has his own porsche shop. like ...what does he know?

oh, he'll sell it to some poor soul who doesn't get the car checked out by a pro...it happens all the time.

mgb -- might be a nice car, although the mention of ""new floorboards"" is a scary thing on an mgb. the wheels look to be from an mga. but in the photos the car looks pretty good. 1967 was a good year, with all-synchro transmission and first year for dual system brakes. mgbs are great fun to own and drive, one of my favorite cars.

rx-7 -- he is priced too high--try $2750."
3680,"April 24, 2006 10:55AM",au1994,"nice rx-7. in my hs years, graduated in 90, that was one of the semi-obtainable cars we lusted for. graduated just up i-65 from birmingham, glad i've moved now otherwise that might be tempting as a weekender if i lived closer. and it were cheaper..."
3681,"April 24, 2006 11:42AM",lilengineerboy,"i like the rx7 too, i have fond memories of those things in high school and the seat belt buzzer that went off at redline. a 12a isn't that hard to work on, and overall the car isn't that powerful, so it was an okay combo for a high school kid (not that we couldn't get into trouble). its biggest problem is 80s japanese car interior disintegration when exposed to sunlight.
i think shifty is on the right track when he noted that the floorboards were fabricated. everyone and their mother (moss, victoria british, etc.) makes floorboards and rust panel replacement. why is he making his own?
the 911 story is why i would never get one without a ppi. i think i know something about them (i knew it was the seal when he mentioned the puddle) but there is so much on those. all these little intricacies with the motor (although that one does have 200k) scare me away."
3682,"April 24, 2006 11:42AM",lemmer,"that rx-7 is only about 10 miles from where i am sitting. i am almost glad his price is too high, because it makes the decision for me.

i had a silver '84 at the end of my undergraduate years in 1992. i drove it for a year before it blew out an apex seal."
3683,"April 24, 2006 11:50AM",Mr_Shiftright,"the motor is the heart and soul of a 911---without a sound motor, you got nuttin' and you're staring a $12,000 repair bill in the face.

these are great and long-lived motors but after years of use they give it up just like any other engine.

at least with an mgb or rx-7, if you have a bad motor you can buy the cars for practically nothing and build one up for way less money than a porsche."
3684,"April 24, 2006 11:52AM",michaellno,"...somewhere in edmunds, but my sister had an '85 rx-7 gs. blue and she added a ""whale tail"" spoiler to it.

she bought it used in '86 (can't remember the purchase price, but the monthly nut was $262/mo, and her and my dad went round and round on whether she should get it or not, since he co-signed for the loan).

anyway, she absolutely loved that car. i did too, when i had the rare opportunity to drive it. it's amazing what 100hp can do when the car is so light. i, too, loved the shift warning buzzer at 7000 on the tach. took it up into the mountains with a friend of mine one night - what a blast in the tight corners! actually got it to oversteer a couple of times in some of the sharper turns.

she kept that car for close to 10 years. it got stolen when she lived in san diego - the sheriff's department called her when they recovered the car.

she sold it only when she got pregnant with the first of my three nephews. i think she got $2200 for it - she sold it to a firefighter and cried the day he drove off in it.

for me, a rwd rx-7 may not be the best car to own in colorado, unless i was financially able to park it in the garage during the winter months. would love to have either a gen-i or gen-ii rx-7 someday, however."
3685,"April 24, 2006 12:19PM",lemmer,"maybe not in total dollars, but the rx-7 is just as bad in percentages as the porsche.

from a quick scan of the web, it looks like a cheap rx-7 rebuild is right at about $2000 plus installation, and you probably don't want the cheapest rebuild. so, it looks like you can go over the value of the car pretty easily. also, piston engined cars are nice enough to give warning signs instead of just instantly crapping out like a rotary - still love the rotary anyway.

how much for a decent mgb rebuild?"
3686,"April 24, 2006 12:23PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well the nice thing about an mgb is that just about anybody can rebuild one, which is not true of a 911 or an rx-7.

so right there the ""b"" offers a tremendous advantage. you could probably rebuild a b engine with parts you found lying in the street. they are so simple and there aren't really any ""traps"" in there beyond normal common sense and diligent assembly.

an amateur working on a 911 engine thinking it's ""just like a vw"" is in for a nasty surprise about that myth.

an rx-7 requires very precise machining tolerances and a clear understanding of how to put a rotary engine together.

but you're right, percentage wise the rx-7 and the older 911 are essentially ""totalled"" when the engine blows up. perhaps not the mgb however."
3687,"April 24, 2006 2:04PM",stickguy,"i found a site a year or so back when i was considering a gen 2 rx-7 convert. they sold the engines all ready to go, shipped to you on a pallet. pretty much just plug and play. they offered various iterations, so you could easily upgrade to a later version i guess, and i think different levels of hop up.

i don't recall them being particularly expensive, 2k sounds about right. makes sense if you get a super clean car with a blown motor for real cheap. at least you would have a reasonable expectaion (and a warranty!) that it wouldn't blow up a week after you bought it."
3688,"April 24, 2006 2:33PM",lilengineerboy,"the 12a (carbureted) and 13b (fuel injected)motors used in the gen 1 and gen 2s were pretty robust, especially in naturally aspirated dress. the turbo and turbo ii slightly less so but they seem to last pretty well. the 3rd gen (93-95) are very sensitive to modification, tuning and maintenance."

3690,"April 25, 2006 6:37AM",lemmer,"i was reviewing an older lady's tax return. she is about 60, but has already been widowed for about two years. all of her investments and everything are still listed in her husband's name and social security number. this could mean a)she doesn't know how to handle her financial affairs b)she is having trouble accepting her husband's death c)she has been too lazy to get the stuff changed over.

here is where the interesting part comes in - while perusing her ad valorem taxes paid on her cars i noticed that in addition to a jointly owned late model buick, in her husband's name she has a pickup truck and a 1974 porsche 911. this is all i know (well i do have the vin and that might provide some clues). i don't know if it is a rusted out hulk or a show car, but it probably is drivable since she has kept it registered.

do i discreetly call the woman and inquire about its condition and its availability?"
3691,"April 25, 2006 7:55AM",au1994,"i think that comes down to the spoken or unspoken code of ethics in your field. i'm sure you have come across a few potential hot stocks or land deals in you time that would have proved to be a financial windfall. whether or not you are allowed to take advantage i, don't know, leagally, ethically or otherwise.

3692,"April 25, 2006 10:18AM",xwesx,"i think i would tend to fall somewhere in there. i think i would be more inclined just to inquire about it if i have an interest in the vehicle type (for example, i would probably be inquiring about the pickup! haha) and the potential history i could learn about it. i think that is one of the best aspects of old cars - they often have very interesting pasts. if something developed into an offer of sale, etc., then that is where your own values or professional code of conduct would have to dictate your actions."

i just know when i was doing a closing on a mortgage for a condo long ago the person doing the closing knew i had won a contest with several items in it and asked me for my opening day tickets for the reds.

ain't no way she would have gotten them. i thought it took chutpah to ask. we were sitting 1000 feet from the ballpark in the offices. she can go find her own tickets. she took advantage of her knowledge of my situation to ask. not proper."
3694,"April 25, 2006 11:32AM",xwesx,"absolutely not and that was unethical. especially if there was some sort of negotiation going on that could be or could be implied to be affected by the outcome of such an inquiry. when it comes to ethics, you really have to ask yourself how your actions could affect another person if they will affect another person. something as mundane as just congratulating someone on winning some tickets could be highly inapporpriate if such sentiments were offered at the wrong time! let alone asking for them. hahah... almost makes you want to kick yourself for doing business with such a person/company and definitely does not put them on the list of potentials for future transactions!"

actually, apart from the oversized rims and the funky lower interior door panels, i don't think this customization is too hideous. i kinda like the black-over-silver 2-tone job, although i don't think these '73-77 a-bodies generally take very well to two-toning. unless it's just a contrasting vinyl roof. there's just something about the way the beltline kicks up in the door, just ahead of the b-pillar, and the way the creases flow with it, that just doesn't lend itself that well, imo, to two-toning.

if factory pimping is more your style, this 1977 electra park ave looks pretty nice.

and finally, rounding out the year 1977 for buick we have this riviera. probably one of the least loved, but more practical rivs. it bridged the gap between the massive excess of the '76, and the fwd complexity of the '79. little more than a high-spec lesabre coupe in '77-78, it still had a decent blend of performance with the 403, good interior room, and a nimble size (for the time). i think i'd be leery of something that sat for 23 years without being started, though!

3709,"April 26, 2006 1:30PM",qbrozen,"well, i can't say for sure ... but i look at it this way ... check out the seller's shop. now, if he isn't restoring it to make a buck, then i would think its not worth it.

of course, better pics might turn me on more. who knows."
3710,"April 26, 2006 3:58PM",volvomax,"i did talk to him, he is a jeweller who is selling the car for a good customer of his.
car needs alot of cosmetic work.
could easily spend $20 grand restoring it i'm afraid."
3711,"April 26, 2006 5:12PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well if you spent $20k restoring it and the bid is already at $16k, you're about done bidding right there...you can find these clean and ready to roll at $35k--$45k.

you'd have to be brave and pray that the engine is okay. very few people will even work on them. they are very complex to get right.

the proper name for this model is ""amv8"" series 2/3.

i like the 200 mph speedo though :p"
3712,"April 27, 2006 6:24AM",lemmer,"kind of a project car.

what do you do with this?

maybe you've got a great vette with a rusty frame?"
3713,"April 27, 2006 6:34AM",qbrozen,"hmmm... so who has all those restored classics and new lambos in the pics? the jeweler or his customer?? do all of those cars belong to his customer? is his customer a restorer (which is what i suspected, which is why i made my comment). i guess it could be just a really nice place he rents space in which to store his car (???).

shifty - wow. i wasn't thinking they were that cheap. that would be a heck of a cool car to have for that kinda $$."
3714,"April 27, 2006 6:40AM",andre1969,"was the '58 corvette? i've never seen just the frame from one, but with that big x member and the boxed frame, you'd think it would've been a pretty solid car. or at least a solid basis for a car!

just out of curiosity, when did gm stop boxing their frames? when they started using those wasp-waisted x-frames? or perimeter frames? all i know is that no gm car i ever owned had a boxed frame."
3715,"April 27, 2006 7:00AM",stickguy,"from the comments section, it doesn't sound like this guy knows what he has!"
3716,"April 27, 2006 7:38AM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh, he knows all right....the '58 vette is imo a ""bitsa"" car---bitsa this and bitsa that, which greatly diminishes its potential value. not much about the car is correct...a [non-permissible content removed] vette. and not a very good restoration from the looks of it. i don't know what kind of ""shows"" he's been winning, but i can't imagine the bar is set very high, given what i see.

so what we have here seems to be an amateur street cobble of a classic car. totally correct and perfect, this car might be worth $60,000. with a good body, paint, upholstery chrome, on this frame, (engine, trans, etc.--the whole enchilada built up from scratch) , maybe $30,000 on a good day if you're lucky and the car looks great.

so the bid (if you even want such a corvette) is already more than enough.

what would i do? i'd have the italians hammer me out a simple aluminum body to my specs and i'd use seats, instrumentation, etc. from some other salvaged sports car--make it a two seaters with side curtains and a flimsy top (like an early cobra). this way you'd have something unique and not just a beater vette that all other vette owners will sneer at.

i don't know why corvette nuts are so fussy about numbers and originality when ferrari owners are not, but that's how it turned out, and the values are very much affected by this nit-picking devotion to numbers. given the early corvettes humble nature, it seems rather silly, but hey, you pay and you get to play your way. model a ford owners are even worse about this.

aston-martin -- it's potentially a car from hell, or the mistress who pouts and asks for diamonds once a week--this is why it's so cheap. if that engine blows up, you are totally, thoroughly, irretrievably screwed to the tune of maybe $30,000. if you can find anyone to fix it, that is. do the math...maybe ten people in america with that expertise. they are going to charge you up the wazoo. at least with a ferrari you have more options with parts, bargaining and mechanics--and in the case of 70s cars, at least a chance for appreciation. not so with the a-m. it'll stagnate for another decade, value-wise."
3717,"April 27, 2006 8:57AM",lemmer,what does that hummer in the background have on its trailer?
3718,"April 27, 2006 9:00AM",qbrozen,looks like a willys.
3719,"April 27, 2006 9:45AM",au1994,a jeepster maybe?
3720,"April 27, 2006 9:48AM",volvomax,"they are storing the car w/ a mechanic who works on exotics.

am v8 prices are all over the place.
there was a decent one up in seattle that went for @$25k on ebay a few months ago.
some dealers are asking $50-60 for nice ones.

i think i'm gonna pass, i really don't have the time to get into a complete restoration project and i don't want to pay big $$$ for a pro to do it."

i don't have good memories of reliability on a factory tt, so i can't imagine what a fraken-z would be like."
3723,"April 27, 2006 1:52PM",lemmer,i had a normally aspirated 1995 300zx. it seemed to be pretty reliable. i hadn't heard that the turbos were significantly less reliable.
3724,"April 27, 2006 2:51PM",xwesx,"looking at that grille, it is definitely a willy's, but cannot see enough behind it to determine body type, etc."
3725,"April 27, 2006 5:08PM",Mr_Shiftright,why don't you look for a nice clean low miles ferrari 308 or 328? or you could buy a killer porsche for this kind of money. british cars from the 70s are generally really bad news.
3726,"April 27, 2006 8:00PM",jrosasmc,"this isn't really a project but you have to take a look at this:

since when does a late-80s mopar m-body go for that much with 35k miles? i thought they weren't collectible cars."
3727,"April 28, 2006 5:17AM",andre1969,"ummm, i'd say about the last time a car like that went for $11,000 with 35k miles on it would have been around 1990 or 1991, when it was a fairly new used car!

this is probably being overly generous, but if i really wanted it, i might offer the guy maybe $4,000. they're about as collectible i guess, as any other sedan from the 80's, which isn't saying a whole lot. they do have a bit of a following because they represented the end of the line for that breed of car, at least in the mopar ranks. and a lot of mopar fans consider the m-body to be the last ""true"" mopar, as many people don't think the term ""mopar"" should be applied to anything based on the k-car or anything that followed.

if it was a later 88 or an '89 it would have been a bit more interesting, because it would have had an airbag. shame it doesn't have a sunroof.

also, while i'm normally not a fan of those lazy-boy button tufted seats, i think they actually suit a car like this very well. the car itself is kinda neoclassic and throwback in styling, so the seats seem appropriate. in something like the '79-85 eldorado, which imo was a bit more sleek and modern in its style, i don't think that type of seat pattern works as well."
3728,"April 28, 2006 6:59AM",lemmer,"is this driver '60 vette worth the bid? has a 350 engine from who knows where

anyone like a torino?"
3729,"April 28, 2006 7:51AM",andre1969,"in the chronic car buyers forum, but figured it would look good here, too...

somebody please talk me down from this! and show me how to block ebay so i can't go to that site anymore! :shades:"
3730,"April 28, 2006 8:00AM",qbrozen,"interesting find. and in my neck of the woods, too. too bad i already bought a car for my brother, this would have been good for him."
3731,"April 28, 2006 8:17AM",andre1969,"that really concern me about that st. regis are the mention about it taking awhile to shift into reverse and the windshield wipers. might just need an adjustment, or it might need a whole rebuild. i think a rebuild on a tranny like this would be around $800-850 these days.

as for the windshield wipers, well my '79 nyer has a problem too, and my mechanic wasn't able to fix them. he at least got them to work again, but they ""park"" in the upright position, and sometimes make a clunking noise when i use them. it doesn't bother me that much, since i don't drive the car a whole lot.

but these r-bodies can be difficult sometimes to find specific parts like that for. some generic things are really easy...for example when my nyer needed new power window motors, i just cannibalized them from my '89 gran fury.

anyway, i'm almost tempted to bid. someone please stop me. :shades:"
3732,"April 28, 2006 8:20AM",fintail,"that st. regis looks like a really nice survivor...i think you could do a lot worse for the money, especially seeing as you really like those cars to begin with it. i'd be really hard pressed to not go for it..."
3733,"April 28, 2006 8:27AM",andre1969,"that st. regis has a reclining passenger side seat. my nyer has that feature, but my '79 newport didn't. was that something that was still pretty rare on big domestic cars back then?

i'm not sure, but i think all of the r-bodies that had a split bench seat had a passenger-side recline.

dangit, this is getting frustrating! my rational side says no, but it's only 3 hours away, wouldn't have to be inspected, would only cost about $51 every two years to register, and about $24 per year to insure if i could get hagerty to cover it. or about $293 per year if i was forced to put it on my regular insurance.

and my insurance went down about $600 this year, so in the long run, i'd still be paying less than last year. dang, now my rational side isn't helping things much anymore..."
3734,"April 28, 2006 8:57AM",Mr_Shiftright,"'70 dodge: well for one thing that 360cid v-8 puts out a whopping 150hp on a good day, while sucking gas doing it, so the only thing that police cruiser is going to be doing is chasing bicycles. aside from that, the transmission sounds like it's about to burp. i personally don't see what type of pleasure one might derive from owning a car like this, especially at the price being asked. the seals are probably hard in the transmission, causing the misfire. $1,200 all day long and that's generous imo. might make an okay winter car or short hop commuter.

'60 vette -- car is fully priced at current bid of $35,000 with nom engine and other issues imo. a bastardized vette takes a big hit in value (should be $60,000 for a #2) but still, it's a vette and most people looking at it won't know. ps: i'm always amazed that people e-mail the sellers and ask ""why are you selling it""? it's like asking ""why are you swimming?"" what's he supposed to do? change his mind after further reflection?

88 chrysler --- it's not actually ""going"" for that price, that's just asking price, with zero bids. it's not collectible and never will be, so ebay bidders know what's what here. demo derby."
3735,"April 28, 2006 9:20AM",andre1969,"i shot off an email to the guy asking what rear end it had in it. it's actually not a police car, but a civilian model that the guy was trying to turn into a police car clone. that's why it just has the 360-2bbl, and most likely it just has the 2.45:1 rear end.

that's the drivetrain my '79 nyer has in it, and for only having 150 hp, it's really not a bad performer. it's not going to blow off a musclecar, or even most new cars. well, it might take on a vulcan taurus or a 2.7 300, or maybe an '05 civic. horsepower's kinda low, but i'd imagine torque is around the 270-280 ft-lb range.

speaking of rear-ends, if you took a car like this st. regis or nyer with a 2.45:1 rear end and swapped in a 2.94:1 or 3.23:1 rear end (both were options), but didn't make any other mods, would it do much for acceleration?

my '89 gran fury had a 2.94:1 rear, and it could kick pretty well, but it was also a police car, so it had a mildly hopped-up engine. it was just a 318, but it had a 4bbl, and 175 hp. it also had a different 1st and 2nd gear ratio than what these r-bodies would have.

basically this st. regis is just a lower mileage, less pimpy version of my nyer, so it's not like it's going to give me a vastly different driving experience. but i'm still tempted. someone snap me out of it!"

it might be a regional thing, but around here it seems like those g-bodies in general are pretty popular, as long as they're not ragged out. they're also the last small-ish, lightweight, easy-to-hot-rod rwd car gm made, so they're a hot commodity for people who want to put a big block in 'em."

3757,"April 28, 2006 5:40PM",Mr_Shiftright,"aston martin---if it were a series 4 car you might have a chance at a passable level of reliability, but anything older than that, then the aston martin owner is in some delusional state. it's simply not possible for an early amv8 to be reliable--the defects were built in so deeply i can't imagine what you'd do---i suppose you could retrofit and upgrade all the series 4 improvements, but man, that wouldn't be cheap.

engine fires are a big issue, too.

if the car is a u.s. model, they don't perform like the uk cars either. american market cars had lower compression and compensated with a higher ratio differential, giving better acceleration with the lower hp usa engine, but reducing top speed to a mere 125 mph or so.

a series 4 car would start with serial # v8sor/12032 and forward.

that's the one you'd want. a uk model would be great but of course it would probably be a rhd.

in top form they are a great handling and performing car but you need to read up on them and shop very wisely for the best of the best from the am factory...

ferraris are quite reliable if you do the services on time. they are just expensive to run (about $1.50 a mile i'd guess) but the ferrari engine is a bear and you can run the hell out of it. mostly where ferrari bites you back in the 1980s is in sheet metal and materials---not the best."
3758,"April 28, 2006 5:45PM",volvomax,"thanks for the info. haven't seen any series 4 cars for sale.

plus, i just blew around $25-30k (i think...i ended up losing track its construction was so piece-meal) on a garage, and then parked a $900 chrysler in it! :shades:

but anyway, i purposely did not watch the auction until after it ended, just in case i got too tempted to bid. i think the high bid ended up being something like $725. the seller also emailed me back, saying he had two firm offers and expected it to be gone today.

so i'm guessing it'll either end up on ebay again soon, or i'll see it at carlisle this summer, with some dreamer trying to push it for $3-4,000!

oh, cruising around the neighborhood yesterday, i saw a 2-tone green '77-79 coupe devil, with no tags on it, parked at the edge of the yard of a house that's for sale. no sign on the car though. judging from the dust and pollen on it, it appears to have been sitting for awhile. wonder if i should go see if they want to unload it? maybe i could offer to just take it off their hands?"

3764,"May 1, 2006 10:04AM",lemmer,"i have a friend who is selling his car and buying a new mustang gt. here is the info:

1996 mustang gt convertible, 4.6 v8 with a 5-speed manual. it is red with a black top and black leather. it has 130,000 miles all by him. he bought it new. he drives a little hard, but doesn't abuse it. in fact he worked his way through college as a car detailer and his car shows it. it looks nearly perfect outside. inside, it is clean but the leather shows normal wear.

the guy is fanatical maintenance and cleanliness including 3000 mile oil changes, weekly washes, and monthly waxes. if he hears a funny noise, he takes it to the dealer and has the offending part replaced immediately with a new ford part. in the last month, he put in a new clutch and new tie rods. it got a new top last year. he even replaced all of the center caps for the wheels because he suspected they were getting loose. it has been in a couple of fender benders and had both bumper covers repainted, but the paint looks outstanding. he is selling it just because it is getting expensive for him to remain a perfectionist.

anyway, his plan is to ask $7,500 and take $7,000. he knows wholesale it is only worth about $3,000, but he has kept it so nice i bet he gets his asking price. i am not a mustang guy or a convertible guy, but i am really tempted to buy it. i would probably drive it for a year a couple of days a week and then sell it.

what do you guys think?"
3765,"May 1, 2006 10:29AM",qbrozen,"i'd be shocked if he gets anywhere near that asking price for it. i don't care if it was placed in a vacuum for the last 10 years, its still just a '96 mustang."

3767,"May 1, 2006 11:38AM",xwesx,"hahaha... i know, though perhaps a car like this would take a little more than beer to look ""purty."" in all honesty there is really not much one can do to talk someone out of something that appeals to him or her unless so many ""what if's"" and ""but then's"" are stacked against it that the person finally has just heard enough.

look at me, i still have my '69 econoline and i insist to my wife that i will never part with it. i told her last week that my grandparents were seriously considering a move to a ""maintenance by dues"" neighborhood so they could get away from yard care and snow removal. she said that if i wanted my grandfather's '76 ford ranger, i would have to get rid of my van. i just laughed... but she said, ""no, seriously. if you bring that truck home without getting rid of something, i am going to leave you."" i laughed again and said, ""hey, if our relationship means that little to you, by all means go."" of course i was just kidding with her, but in the end she compromised and said that she was okay with the truck if i got rid of the '69 banner camper for my '69 c20. done.... i have been just waiting for a really good excuse to axe that old heap. :p"

3778,"May 2, 2006 6:20AM",lemmer,"do car club guys usually value their cars fairly when they sell to each other or do they buy into their own hype and overpay?

also, since you are my size, how well can you fit into various ferraris - 308s and such?"
3779,"May 2, 2006 6:36AM",andre1969,"much of a fan of the lumina, but i always liked the style of the z34 coupe. it's a fuel sipper compared to your typical suv, but the epa rating on the sucker is 17/26. about the same as an lt-1 caprice/roadmaster/etc. or a 300c.

they tended to have junky interiors that fell apart very easily, and the same goes for all the plastic stuff on the exterior. so anybody who bought that z34 would probably have to baby it to keep it looking good.

also, the 3.4 dohc was a good performer, but could be troubleprone and expensive to fix when it did break. it was actually based on the pushrod 2.8/3.1, and once the dohc was dropped, a pushrod 3.4 stuck around.

once gm got the 3800 up to about 200 hp without supercharging, that engine replaced the dohc 3.4 in most applications. it got better fuel economy and didn't give up much in 0-60 times, but it wasn't nearly as responsive and fun to drive at higher speeds."

3783,"May 2, 2006 11:20AM",xwesx,"yeah that car will probably fall apart in the next owner's hands, but all the recent maintenance must be worth something. at least you can be confident that you will not have to dump $2k into the car 100 miles down the road just to get it back into ""daily driver"" order. unless you were really salivating for it, i'd guess $3500-4000 would be extremely generous for a car like this."
3784,"May 2, 2006 11:30AM",Mr_Shiftright,"the mistake most car club members make is to equate rarity with value. just because they have determined through tedious research that they have only 1 of 200 oldsmobile cutlasses made with pink sun visors that year, that doesn't mean it's worth ten cents more than any other cutlass of the same year---except to them.

case in point: there's this owner who has a '55 chevrolet done in a special commemorative paint to acknowledge that in 1955 chevy built its 50 millionth car. so they painted 5,000 4-door sedans in this special gold color. that's it, nothing else was done to the cars. so, it's rare, and there's history, but hey, it's a 4-door sedan with no ac, no conti kit, no special chrome options, etc. who would pay as much for it as they would for a restored bel air hardtop or convertible? very very few people, if any.



ferraris: italian cars are generally really good for bigger guys once you get used to the preferred italian driving position. they like to drive with arms fully extended so they don't have to cross wrists while steering. at ferrari speeds, this makes sense. 328s are my favorite ""affordable"" older ferrari."
3785,"May 2, 2006 11:52AM",andre1969,"would one of those commemorative '55 chevies be worth any more than a regular, non-commemorative 4-door sedan? i've never even heard of one. i've never liked gold cars though, so to me it wouldn't be worth anything.

so they didn't come with any interior upgrades, either?

one car i always get a kick out of, because people often think it's something rare and special, is the 1956 desoto seville. this was actually a stripper package on the 1956 firedome 2- and 4-door hardtops, that was about $100-200 less, and had a cheaper interior. but i guess people see that ""seville"" badging and think they have a treasure!

i dunno if value guides deduct for the ""seville"" package or not, though."
3786,"May 2, 2006 12:08PM",Mr_Shiftright,"the number of 4-door cars that can compete with their 2-door equivalents in value are few and far between. the jaguar mark ii sedan comes to mind, which is quite valuable, and perhaps the impala ss 1994-96. other than that, a 4-door car's ultimate or peak value stops just short of the price of the average 2-door's value.

so i'd say a ""gold commemorative"" '55 chevy 4-door cannot sell for more than a nice driver 2-door '55 hardtop...so that puts us at around $20k--$25k max for a beautifully restored 4-door v8 with good options. i myself wouldn't give over $12,000 for it."
3787,"May 2, 2006 12:18PM",andre1969,"was that a 2-door hardtop should be worth about twice an equivalent 4-door pillared sedan. and then a convertible should be worth about twice an equivalent 2-door hardtop. i'd put a slight premium on a 4-door hardtop or 2-door sedan over the 4-door sedan, but either would still be well below the 2-door hardtop

so if a 4-door sedan was worth $5k, the 2-door hardtop should be worth $10k and the convertible $20k. and a 2-door sedan or 4-door hardtop maybe $5-7k."
3788,"May 2, 2006 1:13PM",Mr_Shiftright,"that's a good rule of thumb. also one should consider ""saleability"". a 4-door post sedan is a real hard sell under any market conditions, unless maybe if it's a 409 chevy or a hemi or something. the 4-door sedans seem to hit a certain ""wall"" of value, regardless of what they are, or how good a condition they are in. right around $10,000 seems to be the ceiling for 99% of all 4 door cars.

the reasons are obvious of course---they aren't all that attractive as a rule, and they are generally the most utilitarian and most commmon of offerings from the automaker. all the sexiness has been taken out of the 4-door line of cars from a manufacturer.

you'd think the 4-door hardtop would sell closer to the two-door hardtop but in fact it sells closer to the 4-door sedan. i think the 4-door hardtop is kind of the bargain of the range."
3789,"May 2, 2006 3:08PM",xwesx,"so, now, straighten me out here. the term ""hardtop"" refers to a car whose top is removable, but the top itself is ""hard"" - meaning it does not collapse and generally would need to stay at home while the rest of the car traveled without it? similar, say, to a bronco or blazer of days gone by? then, a convertible is strictly a fold down soft top or could it also be a hard top, if said top stowed down into the car? :sick:"
3790,"May 2, 2006 3:10PM",xwesx,"i saw one the other day that was a bronco f350 - probably a '95 or '96 (wasn't '96 the last year of the bronco?). it was a 4-door with a good 6' ""bed"" in it - similar, i would say, to a suburban of similar vintage. i had never seen one before and did not even realize such a beast existed."
3791,"May 2, 2006 3:23PM",Mr_Shiftright,"no, 2 door hardtop in the context we are using it (collectible cars) generally refers to an actual ""pillarless"" hardtop with a rigid roof and roll down windows with no center post.

what you seem to be referring to is a convertible with either a removable or retractable hardtop.

usually if you are pricing out old convertibles that had an optional removable hardtop, you'd add a small premium for the removable hardtop (like mercedes 280sl or corvette)."
3792,"May 2, 2006 5:36PM",british_rover,"all broncos were two door.

what you saw was a f-350 crew cab, short bed or something similar."
3793,"May 2, 2006 6:26PM",xwesx,"nope... this one was a bronco. it was a single unit (no separate bed) with a one piece roof (well, it had that sloping transition between fixed and removable top but no separation between cab and bed portions) and was labeled bronco both on the tail and in front of the doors ""bronco"" with ""f350"" below it. the thing was parked in the sam's club lot, so i had plenty of time to look it over. maybe it was a 1-up (seems an odd duck to 1-up though!), but that is what i saw. :confuse:"
3794,"May 2, 2006 6:30PM",xwesx,"ah, gotcha. so that would be like (i think... but i was real young back then) the, um, charger? my mom had back in 1980 with two big doors and a back seat with these little roll-down windows whose ""pillar"" rolled down with the window rather than staying fixed.

interesting. i never knew a pillar could make such a difference in value... :surprise:"
3795,"May 3, 2006 4:54AM",bumpy,"ford didn't build anything like that at the factory. it's a custom job, probably by centurion. i once saw what was essentially a 1996 f-150 suburban done by centurion, and i see an extended-crew-cab dually f-350 around here every so often."
3796,"May 3, 2006 5:54AM",andre1969,"really started to lose its meaning in the 70's. gm was probably the first to muddle it up with its 1973 intermediates, which were referred to as ""colonade hardtops"". basically, all the cool styles, like the convertible and 2- and 4-door hardtops were dropped, allegedly in anticipation of proposed federal rollover regulations which, ironically, never materialized.

the remaining styles, the 2-door, 4-door, and wagon, were given frameless door windows which did make them look cleaner, sportier, and a bit more upscale than an equivalent model with a frame around the door windows, but i'm sure it was also cheaper to build. fewer seals, as the door seal and window seal were one in the same. and i'm sure they saved a bit with not having to build the metal frame around the window. i'm guessing the new style also made it pretty much mandatory that you ordered air conditioning. glass area on these cars was enormous for the time, much more than the '68-72 models. and on the coupes the rear windows no longer rolled down. on 4-doors they went down about 3/4 of the way, but the 4-doors also had a fixed window in the c-pillar and a huge rear window, so no doubt they still let in alot of heat.

even though these things were called ""hardtops"", they did have a b-pillar.

another trend that started in the 70's was to have a car that looked like a hardtop, with no structural b-pillar, but with stationary rear windows. examples of this style would be the lincoln mark v (some later mark ivs also had stationary rear windows), the '79-85 eldorado/toronado/riviera, the ford elite, some versions of the torino, and the ltd-ii/cougar, later versions of the big, pre-downsized grand marquis, the '75-58 intermediate dodge and plymouth coupes, and the '80-83 cordoba/mirada.

the plymouth duster/dodge demon was also kind of in this category. they had no structural b-pillar, just a little chrome strip that was there for the swing-out rear window to hinge too. in fact, i've seen factory photographs of them with the rear window and the little chrome strip taken out, giving the illusion of a hardtop with the windows rolled down.

there are some 70's cars where i actually prefer the 4-door version to the 2-door, mainly because they were still offering a 4-door hardtop. for instance, the big electra, 98, and deville went to a fixed opera window with a landau roof for '75-76, but the 4-doors were still true hardtops. i think the last ""true"" domestic hardtops were the 1978 chrysler newport and new yorker. most of the coupes had a fixed opera window and landau roof, giving them that personal luxury coupe look that was so in vogue back then. a few of them were ordered without that package though, just giving them the standard pillarless hardtop look with a roll-down rear window. kinda ironic that people would pay a premium for an option that made their back windows not roll down. :confuse:

oh, and to continue the silliness, my 1979 new yorker is actually considered a ""pillared hardtop"", a contradictory term if there ever was one. chrysler even went through the effort to come up with a differen vin code for the pillared hardtop...42. 41 was their code for conventional 4-door sedan, and 43 was their code for 4-door hardtop.

i'm not sure, but i think the '95-99 neon, which had frameless door windows, had the 42 code in its vin."

3798,"May 3, 2006 7:02AM",lemko,...how about a hardtop wagon? i'm sure they're quite scarce and skew the values a bit. i love those 1957 buick hardtop wagons. i believe chrysler offered hardtop wagons well into the early 1960s.
3799,"May 3, 2006 7:12AM",qbrozen,oh man! a 164s with low miles and a stick! why do you have to show these things??! i'm always on the lookout for that very combination.
3800,"May 3, 2006 8:10AM",andre1969,"are a somewhat recent phenomenon with regards to desireability. it seems not that long ago that you could barely give them away. they were like maybe a step or two below a 4-door sedan, and people mainly looked to them as parts cars and donor cars. they usually had bigger engines and often beefier transmissions and quicker rear ends, so that made them desireable to cannibalize and put the parts into another car.

nowadays though, it seems like wagons have really shot up in popularity. personally, i wouldn't pay any more for one than i would its 4-door sedan counterpart (i might have to make an exception for some of the cooler hardtop wagons though), but it seems there are people who would.

as for that duster, hey, for $100 i'd take it! especially with the 318! by 1975 standards that's a musclecar! :p"
3801,"May 3, 2006 8:54AM",andre1969,"i like this 1977 grand lemans. and it's not that far away. the biggest downside of it, imo, is the engine. the ad doesn't list the displacement, but i did a vin decode, and if i did it correctly, it has a 301. i've heard that the 301 is just not a durable engine and can't take much abuse, but supposedly if you take care of it, it'll run on forever. i guess you could make a blanket statement like that about any engine, though.

and even though it's a 4-door, i always liked the style of these. the brown color makes me think a bit of buford t. justice's '77 lemans in the first ""smokey and the bandit""."

3805,"May 3, 2006 9:30PM",ghulet,"you'd think if someone were to actually 'restore' a 420sel, which at this point is just a used car, they'd re-paint it a more attractive color (black? charcoal gray?) than light ivory (incorrectly referred to as cream beige, which was actually an mb interior color, often seen with my favorite exterior color of the era, smoke silver). oh, and put the trunk insignias back on the correct (that is, left) side (i hate that). congratulations, sir, you've just put $17k into a car now worth $7k."
3806,"May 4, 2006 6:58AM",lemmer,"it looks like i did a fine job of talking some sense into my friend. a portion of his email to me this morning:

did some further research yesterday, and have decided to list my car for $8500. you would not believe how many 96 gt convertibles were going for that price or more with various mileage. most were automatics, and showed significant wear in various places..i saw a gt with more than my mileage going for almost 10,000! i am not going to push that envelope because of my mileage, but i think 8500 is fair.

he clearly confuses askin' with gettin' prices."
3807,"May 4, 2006 10:00AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well he might get lucky and have someone pay over market---but weird deals high or low don't set the market. if he's a good bs-er then he might get his price---sounds like he is a good salesman and can spread some pixie dust over the buyer's eyes.

to be fair, you can't really price a car accurately until you eyeball it, but this car better be flawless in/out/sideways to even approach that price."

it seems that with the mark v, color can make all the difference in the world to me. if i see one in the right shade of blue or green, i'll almost melt for it. for intance, my buddy's two mark v's are both diamond jubilees with a light, icy metallic blue paint, matching blue landau top, and a light blue fabric interior. but in some of the more period 70's colors, or with a gaudy enough interior, it just doesn't do it for me.

but then something like a '75-76 electra/ninety-eight, '76-77 lemans, or mopar r-body, the color probably wouldn't affect me unless it was something truly grotesque."

3822,"May 10, 2006 11:35AM",au1994,i was thinking the same thing. i've never heard of anyone doing anything hot rod wise with a ford 400. a 460 maybe. i've seen a few chevy 400's in hot rods.

how would something like that perform? i'm guessing that 330 is a 2-bbl, with maybe 250-260 hp gross? i know the 2-speed automatic tended to really hurt performance on the smaller engines, like say a chevy with a 283/307, but would something like this have enough torque to overcome that? the last car i drove with a 2-speed automatic was a 1958 desoto firesweep, but i'm sure it was lighter than a '66 olds. plus, it had a 350 wedge with something like 280-290 hp, so it had no trouble getting out of its own way!"

if i hadn't bought my '76 grand lemans last year, i think i'd already be in the bidding on this one! even though the interior's a bit more basic and less-optioned than mine. i love the color combination, though! the only thing that bugs me about this one is that the car looks nice for the most part, and then under the hood it looks all dirty and dusty, and the master cylinder looks like it's rusty.

i guess the bidding is getting a bit high on it, though."
3830,"May 11, 2006 10:20AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i think he has to come down on the price some more. the cheesy paint job ($1,600? maybe to paint a dumster!) devalues the car and probably will fall off on the first bump. so that's one issue. other than that, best you can do is have it checked out. remember, repairs on this car are very very expensive... a timing belt and water pump could easily nail you $1,500. still, if it checks out, and you can put enough padding in the selling price to allow yourself a quick $2000 in maintenance, you might be okay. they are very good handling cars, equal of any modern automobile."
3831,"May 11, 2006 10:45AM",lemmer,"i also have been emailing a guy about a nice red '86 944 all original and in good 'used car' shape. it has 112,000 miles and only 3k on the timing belt/water pump. he has come down from $6800 to $6200 without me asking. he doesn't want to come down much more because he isn't willing to lose money on the car (spurious reasoning as that may be).

if he can't get what he wants for the 944, he will try to sell his '76 2.0 914 said to be appraised by automobile atlanta at $8500 (don't know what he would want for it)."
3832,"May 11, 2006 10:54AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well you know $5,500--$6,500 seems to be the going rate for clean ""needs nothing"" type 944 drivers up to 1987 models. the only time you can get any more than that is if you upgrade the 944 to newer specs, offer a newer 944 (1988 on up) or put on all kinds of delicious expensive goodies on the early cars.

automobile atlanta is in no impartial position to appraise a 914 since they are dealers in those cars. it would have to be one spectacular 914 for that kind of money, but it's possible to get that for a real stunner.

i think about $6,500 is all the money for 99% of the early 944s or all 1.7 & 1.8 914s you'll see for sale. later 944 turbos and s2s and of course s2 cabriolets can pull more money. 86-87 models are worth a little more than 83-85s. for the 914s, 1.7 and 1.8 liter are worth the same, and 2.0 liters are worth $1k more.

i myself would take a 944 ""s"" + turbo and pay the additional $$$ to get that, maybe up to $12,000 for a beauty or higher for a highly modified one. a well-equipped, well-done 944 turbo will match the performance of just about any modern car on the road today."
3833,"May 11, 2006 10:57AM",lemmer,"i also am thinking of raising my price ceiling and going to look at a so-called perfect 1986 944 turbo with 86,000 miles for $11,000. is that a decent deal if i could get it for less than $10,000?

also, the paper has an '88 turbo s at $12,000. these cars in general seem better maintained than the base 944s, maybe because they are still a little higher than the 'beater' price range."
3834,"May 11, 2006 11:08AM",Mr_Shiftright,"a turbo s is rather rare, that's why you pay more.

personally i think an s2 is the way to go. you get about 217 hp, which is close to the turbo (but not the turbo s), without all the turbo hassles.

a turbo s is a screamer, putting you 0-60 in the low 5s."

3836,"May 11, 2006 12:18PM",stickguy,"i almost bought one of those new, although i think it was an '87 (not 16v), but a gti of that body style.

3838,"May 11, 2006 1:04PM",lemmer,"for people who think '90s civics will be collectible one day because the 'fast and furious' crowd likes them, take a look at that gti price. watercooled vws were all the rage for a lot of the generation x crowd. nobody seems to care about them at all now. reallly fun to drive, but compared to modern cars they have very little power and are unreliable. maybe i am wrong; maybe they just need a few more years to come back up in price. but, i doubt it.

regardless, i still wouldn't mind having an '81 scirocco s with a later 16v engine in it. i just wouldn't be willing to pay much for it."

3842,"May 12, 2006 9:50AM",lemmer,"dogs? that is kind of a stretch for a car that does 0-60 in 6 seconds and tops out over 150 mph.

that being said, i would much prefer a manual.

here is some more info on that 914 i previously mentioned. it looks perfect in pictures (not that means much), but here is the commentary -

this 914 came from boise idaho and was stored for
a number of years. it drives very good. the sync is starting to go in
2nd gear and occasionally a little blue smoke from the right cylinders
when i down shift hard, it drives great. (it also leaks a little oil).
it was painted once about 15 yrs ago. i have started working on the
rust in the rear trunk which is just surface rust and is limited to the
trunks and one or two small spots under the paint, and both floor board
at the rear where it is welded to the fire wall has begun to rust. auto
atlanta suggested that i have that welded, and not replace the entire
floorboard. they appraised it at $8.500.00. i have put new struts and
shocks on it."
3843,"May 12, 2006 9:59AM",stickguy,"with all those problems, if it was mine, i would have politely handed auto atlanta the title and asked for a check.

that is going to cost a bundle to make right, unless you just decide to drive it until it craps out. if so, 8.5k is way too much to pay."
3844,"May 12, 2006 10:02AM",lemmer,"i agree. i kinda lost interest when i got the full description. however, his 944 is still a prospect."
3845,"May 12, 2006 10:03AM",Mr_Shiftright,"the ""appraisal"" is absurd beyond belief. i wouldn't give him $1,500 for a 914 in that condition. i wouldn't give him $8,500 for a 1990 911 in that condition. all he needs is a transmission rebuild ($5000) and new pistons, barrels and rings, and welding of a unibody !! frame.

geez, i'll find you a spotlessly clean 914 with a rebuilt engine for that price."

i remember one day i yelled at someone out in the parking lot because they ran a stop sign and almost whacked my then-new intrepid. he said he could hear me yelling all the way down at the 7-eleven, where he was hanging out. he was a bit miffed that i did that, but i told him that out there in the parking lot, you do something stupid that endangers my life, and i will call you on it. plus, that's the same parking lot that sent my '86 monte carlo to junkyard heaven. he didn't seem to care, but then a few days later, someone ran a stop sign in that same parking lot and creamed him in his z!

needless to say, he apologized after that. :shades:

nice looking car---downside is incredibly complex car that is expensive to repair, and it'll suck gas pretty good. i'd certainly give one a rigorous mechanical inspection, and if it passes, i'd do it again. one major repair on this car and you are upside down for life.

the automatic might be a better choice, as this is more of a gt car than a sports car, and an auto trans might not have been flogged as much as a 5-speed. i'm not even sure you could get an automatic tt, but i presume so."
3848,"May 12, 2006 10:39AM",lemmer,"road & track had a used car classic on the final 300zxs in which one of there experts recommended an automatic 2+2 above all others, as it wasn't as complex as a turbo and not likely to have been abused as a turbo or a 5-speed.

andre is right; i think all the turbos have been molested. i guess i meant unmodified. i wonder how many ""unmodified"" turbo cars just have their chips and boost controllers removed right before they place an ad in the paper."

6 sec 0-60 is nothing special for a gt car.
an auto z tt would get killed by a contemporary rx-7, vette, or supra turbo.
tha manual z turbos were nice competent cars.comfortable and fast."
3851,"May 12, 2006 11:02AM",Mr_Shiftright,"personally i think the fixation on 0-60 speeds is kind of silly, given the real world we drive in. a second here or there becomes rather irrelevant once you drop down to 7 seconds or less.

a gt car should have lots of torque, a nice loafing highway speed, and should feel comfortable and stable in high speed cornering. it's not a sports car (too much work to hustle around the twisties) but it can do it if you have to. a 300zx seems to fit this gt profile quite nicely, whereas a c4 corvette or rx-7 definitely don't. the supra probably does gt very well, too."
3852,"May 12, 2006 11:34AM",lemmer,"i would guess all of those cars are half a second slower in automatic guise. street starts are probably the same auto or manual. i doubt there is any killing going on within the confines of public roads, maybe at the drag races.

in this strange age of kids drag racing japanese cars, i don't really fixate too much on straight line performance. for the more sports cars oriented models(like the rx-7) i would be more concerned with lap times and fun to drive quotient. with cruisers like the z and the supra, comfort enters the equation. don't get me wrong, i am a big fan of power. however, if i cared about 0-60 all that much i would just modify a mustang or some such."
3853,"May 12, 2006 12:13PM",volvomax,"0-60 has some importance simply because we all like pulling away from a traffic light as quickly as possible.
lets face it, none of us can drive a car over 100mph anywhere, but we can all hammer the car away from a light.

i had 2 c4 vette's, they were actually good road cars. good gas mileage @ highway speeds.
i have a c5 now that is much better, esp w/ the adjustable suspension and the sport seats."
3854,"May 12, 2006 12:26PM",andre1969,"it's funny sometimes, how cars can feel faster or slower than their actual acceleration times suggest. for example, i always considered my '85 silverado with its 305-4bbl to be dog-slow. it felt alot slower than, say, my '79 new yorker with its 360-2bbl or my '76 lemans with its 350-2bbl.

however, on my way to work, there's a short merge lane where i have to get onto a 4-lane divided road. at the end of that merge lane, i could usually have the nyer up to 50 mph, and the lemans up to around 45 (a little embarrassing, because the lemans looks sportier and ""tougher"" than the nyer). well, the other day i noticed that if i really punch it, the truck will also be doing about 45 at the end of that merge ramp. so it's not as dog-slow as i thought. but still nothing to get excited about!

btw, where did the phrase ""dog-slow"" come from, anyway? most dogs i've had could run pretty fast."

they aren't that cheap if you go for a early to mid 90's car.
i wouldn't buy an 80's c4 if i were you.
my 86 was a nightmare, my 93 was flawless.
the 93 was better built, faster, and better on gas.
stay away from the z51 suspension as it is rock hard.
fx3 adjustable suspension is the way to go.
maintenance isn't bad. replacing the battery is a pain, and the cars tend to eat u-joints. heat is the enemy of the c4, the airflow under those big clamshell hoods isn't very good. especially in traffic.
you could proably pick up a mid 90's c4 for the low teens in nice shape."
3858,"May 12, 2006 2:28PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i've seen early 90s go pretty cheap at auction...not $5k but sometimes under $10k for a coupe #3 or #2. of course, a really nice, well-kept, babied low miles 90s c4 is going to cost more but i can't imagine anything over $12,500 to $15,000 for the very best.

corvette's the kind of car where the later the model evolution, the better for you. kinda like a porsche in that regard and not like a nissan z car.

maintenance should be a breeze compared to most sportscars, unless of course you have to buy special trim parts or have to repair the body. you smack up an old c4, you best junk it.

one reason they are so cheap is that they made a lot of them."

the grey/silver was the common lower color on white mb back in the day iirc, i have seen late 126 in that same color combo. my 126 was light blue on top, darker blue on bottom. lo and behold, early lexus ls used the same idea."
3870,"May 13, 2006 11:25AM",andre1969,"yeah, it's an automatic. thm350c tranny. the engine is a 305-4bbl with 165 hp at something like 4400 or 4800 rpm, and i think peak torque is 245 ft-lb @2400 rpm?

i actually had no idea the truck was as heavy as it was until one day that i pulled onto a junkyard scale. after subtracting out my weight and the weight of a friend that went with me, i'd say it was around 4200-4300 lb. for some reason i always thought it was around 3800. don't ask me where i got that figure, though!

one thing that holds my truck back is its rear end, which i'm pretty sure is a 2.56:1 when my granddad got this truck, he never intended to use it for anything heavy-duty, as he had a 3/4 ton '76 gmc crew cab at the time that could do just about anything he needed it to. but it got about 10 mpg no matter how hard you worked it or how easy you went on it, and was about 21 feet long, so this '85 was kind of his run-about/errand car!

now the few times i hauled topsoil in it, i knew i was chancing it, so i drove as gently as i could. andthe place is less than a half-mile up the street, so i didn't have to drive too far, or on any high-speed roads. interestingly though, on other occasions where i've loaded the truck down, such as running a load of firewood down to my mom's, the extra weight didn't seem to slow the truck down any. i have no idea how much a bed full of firewood would weight (8-foot bed, stacked about to the top of it, and a little higher in the center) but my stepdad said probably about a ton.

when i'd drive loaded like that, i'd try to leave myself plenty of extra room, and really try to time it right when accelerating up a highway merge ramp, but it turns out i'd usually end up being overly cautious, as the truck seemed to take it all in stride. still, better safe than sorry!"

3884,"May 16, 2006 6:12AM",lemmer,"tomorrow i plan to go with a friend to look at this '59 corvette. the car is actually in tuscaloosa, alabama at the widow's house.

any tips? also, how do you verify low mileage and matching numbers? don't people fake that stuff now?"
3885,"May 16, 2006 9:52AM",Mr_Shiftright,"matching numbers would be very difficult to fake on a '59 corvette, since you'd have to fake both the chassis's vin and the engine number, (the two match on this car) and given the car's value in top restored condition (which this is not) of maybe $60,000--$65,000 for a totally correct stunner, i don't much see the point in risking fraud....since incorrect cars are selling at about $35k-40k. given the description, i think the car is already overbid, but not too badly (yet). reserve is too high that's for sure.

verifying low miles? very hard to do, almost impossible. unless there is some fantastic documentation (sequential repair orders dating from 1959, showing progressive mileage up the current time), then it's all smoke and mirrors. the seller's ""word"" is all well and good but you can't give that word to anybody else...it's already second-hand info, and with you it'll be third hand.

so anyway, check the engine number for the correct number sequence by matching it against the vin number on the steering post in the engine compartment. also check the engine's ""suffix"", usually two letters. also the casting number, which is found right where the engine meets the bell housing, driver's side.

you should really look up all these numbers and color codes and options list before you go. don't be babes in the woods.

might be a decent buy if the price doesn't go up too much more. be sure to check for stress cracks in the fiberglass and for a rusty frame. if this car is original paint, you should see a chalk mark with the color code in the trunk, on the right side hinge.

some resto items are going to be very very dear to correct---like the windshield surround.

have you driven a '59 before? remember, no power steering, drum brakes...take it easy.

ps: i think all these numbers are available online somewhere. don't leave home without them!"
3886,"May 16, 2006 10:02AM",fintail,"lol at the ""gullwing""...i think he put a couple extra zeroes in the price. if i had that, i would sell off the useful bits like the engine and seats, and put the body in my backyard or beside an old barn etc...and see people go nuts and look it over, offer to buy it etc, thinking it is real."

the 2.0 has k-jetronic (i'm pretty sure) fuel injection and is reasonably entertaining. its on my list; more so than the 70s 924 that replaced it. a 914-6 is actually legitimately cool by almost any account but they are getting pricey."

the '69-73 were really just the same thing...new yorkers with a few extra inches of wheelbase, but at least they looked different, with those sleek front ends with the hidden headlights that made them look a bit futuristic. and even the '74-75, i thought was a nice looking car, although it was just a new yorker with hidden headlights, and basically became the new yorker for '76-78."

the '57-66 imperial were essentially all the same basic car, although it got a heavy facelift in 1960 that also modified the roofline. they were able to square off the roof a bit over the years to make it appear more modern, and also squared off the sheetmetal, but one thing they never could hide was the wraparound windshield and associated a-pillars.

that guy who did the '61 lincoln was elwood engle. he started fixing up exner's work with the '63 dart and valiant, and the '63 chryslers. he may have also been responsible for de-finning the imperial for '62."

it's interesting how gm used to play around with the wheelbases on those cars. in 1969, i know the chevies were 119"", while the pontiac catalina was 122"" and the bonneville was 125"" i think the delta was 124"". well, on the bonneville, you could see where the extra 3"" was added; that little space between the rear wheel opening and the rear door was about 3"" bigger, although the doors themselves and the greenhouse were all the same.

according to a book i own, which is alternately sloppy and/or inaccurate at times, list the base engine for the 'base' delta 88 as a 350 four-barrel with 250hp; its stats, though, are exactly the same as the base engine for the cutlass supreme, which is listed as having a two-barrel, though with the same compression ratio and horsepower as the four-barrel. so something's wrong. interesting to note is that the only 455s listed with two-barrel carbs throughout the gm line are the '68 delta 88 (the delmont had a 350), the '69 delta 88 custom (non-custom being base) and all '70 delta 88s, all with 310hp. not bad, considering my '71 four-barrel 455 electra 225 had 315hp."

still, $8500 seems like an awfully cheap base price for something like this back then. the american standard book listed air conditioning as being an option though, so maybe the consumer guide encyclopedia just listed the price with a bunch of options added in?

my grandparents' '75 dart swinger was about $5,000, so i'd think that a more prestigious, larger, loaded car, plus 4 years of 70's style inflation, would drive the base price of a nyer up by more than $3500 above it."

as for that old '48 dodge, i guess if nothing else, it does look like there's a lot of salvageable parts there. for the most part though, those old cars from that era don't excite me that much. a 1953 desoto is probably about as far back as i'd go, and that's probably more nostalgia than anything else, as my granddad had picked one up when i was a little kid, and then got rid of it just before i got my learner's permit. i actually know where it is, but it's been sitting in the same spot now for about 20 years, at the edge of a clearing. and the electrical system got fried when the guy tried to jump it with a 12 volt system."

updated 8:16 am et may 20, 2006

federal agents seized a mercedes-benz from an army reservist who said the armor-plated, bulletproof luxury car probably belonged to saddam hussein.

first sgt. william von zehle said he bought the car while serving in iraq. u.s. immigration and customs enforcement agents said the car, which was also equipped with loudspeakers and hidden microphones, was being treated as a ""possible war trophy.""

""it belonged to the former iraqi regime,"" ice spokesman dean boyd said. he said investigators were unsure whether the former iraqi dictator actually owned it.

von zehle was quoted in news stories last summer as saying he bought the car for about $5,000 in 2003 while serving in baghdad with the 411th civil affairs battalion. ""i can't prove it, but yeah, this was saddam hussein's car,"" he said.

the car was seized thursday. a call to von zehle's home in ridgefield on friday was not immediately returned.

federal agents are holding the car while investigating possible violations of federal smuggling laws and an executive order barring the importation of property from the former iraqi regime.

von zehle was not charged with a crime.

the white mercedes was also equipped with a series of pipes that shoot flames out the side of the car, von zehle has said."

my buddy is thinking about taking it up to carlisle for the ford nationals and trying to sell it, but when he said he thought he'd only get $3-4k for it, my ears perked up. he used to be a bit delusional about these cars and their worth, but has since come down to earth.

here's a pic of my buddy's matching set. the ""beater"" is in the front and the ""good one"" is behind it.

wonder if it's soon going to be time for me to go down to park and planning and apply for another garage building permit. :surprise:

also, it just hit me...this would be the first f-word i've ever owned. i hope that's not a sign of the coming apocalypse or something! :p"
3963,"May 22, 2006 2:55PM",Mr_Shiftright,"price sounds about right for a fully functioning #4 car. you can buy the best one the world has ever seen with extra low miles (under 50k) for about $12,000, and around $8,500 should find you a really clean daily driver with higher miles that doesn't need paint. so if you start subtracting downward from the primo car at $12k, basically a beater mark v diamond isn't worth much at all."
3964,"May 22, 2006 3:31PM",fintail,"oh, i was wondering if you were shopping for one. i've noticed a few really nice ones locally on cl, for slightly more than your price range. one was even that light blue, i believe i posted it here. not a diamond jubilee though.

this is in my backyard...high maintenance color though

i agree with your opinion about the color...it's the only one i would want, and it does suit the car. just a bit lighter than the blue on that fleetwood i posted, which is also pleasant on the car."
3965,"May 22, 2006 3:38PM",andre1969,"really turn me on when they're the right shade of blue or green. only problem with green though is that sometimes some of the greens they use on the inside are pretty clashy. i could also deal with a midnight blue or black one, and maybe a white one, with the right interior color. but some of those browns, golds, champagnes, etc, do nothing for me.

if i were getting one of these monsters, i'd also want a 460, which my buddy's car has. a lot of them only had 400's, which had 179 hp in '77, 166 hp in '78, and 159 hp in '79. ouch!!

it's kinda funny how some cars i'd be happy with no matter how awful the color, like a '76 lemans or electra, or a '79-81 mopar r-body. and on some of those cars i'd even be happy with a less-than-optimal engine (as long as it's not a 231/250/260 in the lemans or a slant six in an r-body!) but with the mark v, it seems much more dependent on the color and engine with me.

common sense is really telling me though that i should take that $3-4k that i'd be spending on this car, plus insurance, and put that money towards fixing up my other cars."
3966,"May 22, 2006 3:46PM",fintail,that's what i would do...put it in the other cars. 3-4k can do a lot of fix up work.
3967,"May 23, 2006 9:37AM",volvomax,"personally, i would go for an earlier mark iv.
the had the good 460's and a better looking body."
3968,"May 23, 2006 9:45AM",jaserb,"i've finally gotten the alfa back on the road. this wasn't a concours restoration by any means, but it's a pretty nice driver now. i went back and forth for a while deciding whether or not to leave it the original color but i'm glad i did.

3971,"May 23, 2006 10:25AM",qbrozen,"i can't believe you even considered not keeping it yellow. ok, maybe a little darker yellow would be nice, but still, i think yellow spiders are the best looking. i thought about changing my original color, too, and yellow would have been the easy choice. but, in the end, i also decided to stay original and stuck with the black."
3972,"May 23, 2006 11:04AM",lemmer,"that car looks great! it makes me want one. but, why do you hate spica. it is just a matter of getting it set up correctly, right?"

3975,"May 23, 2006 12:46PM",jaserb,"i had to replace the injection pump due to excess wear leaking gas into the sump. then i had to replace the head gasket, and all the metal fuel lines made it about twice as hard as it needed to be.
then the injection pump siezed with about 300 miles on the rebuild, leaving me stranded on the side of the road. the guy re-rebuilt it for free, but i had to do another r&r which is not fun. long story short, i know way more about spica fuel injection than i ever wanted to. it runs pretty good now, but i'm still a bit shell shocked.

if it weren't for the fact that i still need to pass emissions every year i would have yanked the injection for webers in a heartbeat.

i have no problems with the spca. i like doggies and kitties.

qbrozen, one of the reasons i kept the original yellow is because it is so light - i'm not a fan of the orangey yellows.

3976,"May 23, 2006 1:43PM",Mr_Shiftright,"webers can be a nuisance as well. they are fussy, and really work best at wot. you'll drop in gas mileage, too.

will be interesting to see what this sells for since it is fairly close to the one we have for sale but not in nearly as good a shape.

never really like this special edition

3997,"May 24, 2006 11:06AM",stickguy,"my bil had one identical to that, even the same color, about 15 years ago. might make a good platform for a hot rod/ss clone.

reminds me, i was watching a show yesterday (i think on tlc) where some guy builds up custom muscle machines, and then tries to flip them at one of the big auctions for a profit. i think his name is bill white? specialty muschle machines is his shop iirc.

anyway, yesterdays show was a 1970ish torino. absolutely mint car, with absurdly low miles. kicker is, it was strippo model, 6 cyl at. the did a nice paint job, and upgraded suspension/brakes/wheels, etc. but mostly, they stuffed a custom made big honker v8. buitiful looking piece.

oddly, they left the interior perfectly stock, which was probably a turn off.

at russo and steele auction, it was a no-sale at about 30k, which i htink was less than it cost to build. the interior might have had something to do with it, plus torinos don't really seem to have much of a following."
3998,"May 24, 2006 11:08AM",Mr_Shiftright,"you could perform the ""shiftright 15 minute used car test"".

what you do, if you can get the car alone, is to drive the hell out of it for 30 minutes. floor it, go up hills, rev it up (but not abuse it), drive fast and furious, stressing engine, brakes, etc. if it's not a steaming heap of rubble by the end of the 30 minutes, it's a keeper.

my motto is: ""if it'll go 50 hard miles, it'll go 5,000 miles""."
3999,"May 24, 2006 11:50AM",michaellno,"the show on tlc is called ""wrecks to riches"".

i've seen a few episodes so far ... caught part of the one last night, but didn't see the ending.

most of the time, they take cars that are in truly horrible shape and do a frame up restoration. sounds like the one last night was an exception to that rule. they keep track of the $$$$ spent and the man-hours invested. they set a time limit of 4 weeks, and the car goes to auction and they see if they can recoup the rebuild costs.

the guy's name is barry white, and his specialty is creating ""super muscle cars"" - essentially, an old muscle car body style with new hardware underneath - suspension, wheels, steering, engine.

i guess you could say he creates clones -- a couple of weeks ago, he took a tempest and turned it into a gto wannabe by purchasing and adding a new front clip. there have been episodes where he's created mustangs, plymouth satellites, the gto, a camaro, and one or two others that escape me.

the first episode was probably the funniest .. he 'stole' his daughters car to restore without her knowing about it. she was pretty peeved but at the end of the show he pulls up in an identical car for her to work on."
4000,"May 24, 2006 11:57AM",qbrozen,"i saw an episode of that once, i think. now i'll have to search for that title.

anyway, in the episode i saw, they took 2 cars and made them into one decent clone. i can't remember what it was, though. in any case, i don't see how they can stay in business. he paid something like $70k in parts and got $80k for the car ... but that means he only got $10k to pay for the 500 man hours that went into it. you're not getting quality people for $20/hour, that's for sure. and let's not forget about overhead like the rent on the shop, electricity, etc, etc. and they were excited they made money on it. huh???"
4001,"May 24, 2006 12:25PM",au1994,"caught a few episodes of that and find it just ok. just does not grab my attention for some reason, could be the personalities or it could be the cars. i don't find the cars they do to be that outstanding. nice, don't get me wrong and far better than my imagination, bank account and skill level could do, but not an 80k car.

was a big fan of overhaulin when it first came out, but now they seem to be focused more on the pranks and general silliness rather than the car and the design. i usually tivo it now and just fast forward through most of the show until the end. foose still does some great looking cars, especially when he has a half way decent starting point."
4002,"May 24, 2006 2:01PM",Mr_Shiftright,my opinion was that the rush jobs they do on these cars is going to create problems further down the line. a car that is slammed together in a week? no thanks.
4003,"May 24, 2006 2:29PM",michaellno,"""overhaulin'"" has a week. ""wrecks to riches"" has four weeks. the latter show seems to be more indicative of how the process really works. in each episode, there is usually one aspect of the rebuild that doesn't go exactly as planned - they can't get a particular part, the part is the wrong size, etc.

last night, iirc, they screwed up on the brakes that were ordered - they wanted to install 4 wheel discs, but they got two pairs of rear brakes instead of one front and one rear set. the 'designer' usually gets hammered by the boss for the goof up, and has to spend hours on the phone getting the issue resolved.

one time, they spent $5k on a used hemi block with the intention of rebuilding it. when they took it all apart, they found that the main block had a crack and the engine was useless. they ended up ordering a brand new hemi for some outrageous price (over $10k) and got it at the last moment to install.

edit: of course, there is always the classic mtv show ""pimp my ride"" - this is pretty much all flash and they don't really do anything mechanical to the car."
4004,"May 24, 2006 4:46PM",british_rover,"the last classic range rover i took in trade was a couple of years newer then that one but with about the same miles and probably in the same shape.

i think we gave him about $1800 for it and we made money on the wholesale side.

for 500 bucks buy it drive it till it blows something up and when it does give me a call i know people who can take it off your hands. hell depending on my situation at the time i might take it off your hands. i wouldn't mind having a classic rover to go willing in and it would look very cool for out events to have an old range rover there.

i have looked at a fair share of classic rovers and our shop foreman has rebuilt several of them. i can tell you the bad things to look out for i just need to ask him a couple of questions tomorrow. if you want to know what to look for give me an email."

4011,"May 25, 2006 5:43AM",au1994,"i wondered about that myself. surely, as part of the agreement to be on the show, the car is given a thorough once over after the camera's stop rolling. wonder if they are given any type of warranty?"
4012,"May 25, 2006 6:23AM",qbrozen,"yup, that's mine. triple black. the nice part about it is the red stitching on the veloce seats really stands out.

by the way, i'm about to order $1500 in parts for my spider. the wife gave the go ahead to use some of the proceeds from selling my volvo to do what needs to be done. it's mostly mechanical stuff (getting a rebuilt head from iap, along with the gasket set, clutch slave cylinder, intake hose [current one is held together with duct tape], and a bunch of other stuff), and just a couple of cosmetic items (trunk release has been busted for years).

overall, if i figure in everything over the years, i've probably got $5,500-$6k into the car, including purchase price. i'm not sure how to look at that. i could get a real nice one for that kind of money and not have had to put all the labor into it. but, then again, we're talking $6k over something like 6 or 7 years. and, at this point, i think i'd still get close to my money out of it. and after 6 or 7 years of ownership, that's pretty good.

i agree about the silver. unfortunately, it seems like every quad i've ever seen was silver. and the red stitching on the grey seats never really did it for me, either."

thanks for the heads-up, bumpy, but i don't think this particular itch would ever turn into that much of a rash! i always did kinda like the ventura though. probably because they were fairly rare compared to a nova, so they seemed a bit more unique. even if they were a harbinger of the badge-engineering frenzy that was to come.

i halfway suspect the guy who runs the place got a dealer's license just to keep the county from getting after him for having too many cars on his property

4014,"May 25, 2006 11:43AM",ghulet,"...but i always thought this was a great design, in theory, at least. iirc, the last of the 'true saabs', fwiw, which apparently isn't much:

http://chicago.craigslist.org/car/164588242.html

unfortunately, it's become rare to see these in better-than-mechanical-nightmare condition (i like the 'needs timing belt, $30 plus labor,' which we can only guess how bad that would be on this thing). i have to wonder, too, unless this isn't the case with these, why they didn't just change the timing belt when they replaced the water pump?

in any case, if i had to own one of these, it wouldn't be an automatic."

4018,"May 25, 2006 1:00PM",andre1969,"and i love that color combination! the only problem with these '74-75 imperials though, is that imo they got their thunder stolen from them by the 1976-1978 new yorker brougham, which was the same car, cheaper (when adjusted for inflation), and actually a bit ritzier (i.e., pimpier) inside! plus, while many cars continued to lose hp as the 70's wore on, i think the 440 stayed at 205 hp in the imperial/nybrougham right up through 1978. interestingly, there were some versions of the 400 that were more powerful, but i think they mainly went into chargers, cordobas, etc.

i do like seeing one without leather, though. if i had the space and the spare cash, that one would be welcome in my garage anytime!"
4019,"May 25, 2006 1:23PM",Mr_Shiftright,"hmmm...a saab 9000 that needs a timing belt?how novel. most of them have chains and most of them fail. and it has 164k on it? how about free? how about they pay you to remove it?

remember the engine is reversed in that car, so the timing chain faces the firewall. also, you can't just replace the chain, you need a timing chain & balance kit.

see diagram for the pieces you'll need:

http://www.thesaabsite.com/9000/timingcomponents2.3l.htm

so figure $500 parts + a lot of labor.

this isn'ta $900 car. this is a $2,900 car, and so why not just go buy a running one for 1/2 that?

junkyard or sell for $350 to a handy diy-er. and may god have mercy on his soul."
4020,"May 25, 2006 2:37PM",gsemike,that guy is from englishtown nj which has a big drag strip. so what do you think it will run?
4021,"May 25, 2006 2:54PM",andre1969,"so what do you think it will run?

truthfully? probably 0-60 in about 12-13 seconds. quarter mile in the low 18's i guess, at maybe 75 mph?

these later imperials weren't fast. in fact, chrysler even apologized for them in one of their ads from around 1970 or so saying that they didn't set out to build a performance car, so if your only concern was 0-60 you were probably better off with a caddy or lincoln. but if you wanted luxury and comfort and style, that's what they were all about.

personally, i think the '69-73 imperial was a beautiful car, and i even find the '74-75 attractive. i think they're more stylish than competing lincolns from the time, and the '71+ cadillacs. the '69-70 caddy was a looker though, imo.

but by that time, they really were hindered by not offering much more than a chrysler new yorker. at the same time though, did a '74 deville really offer much more than a '74 electra or ninety-eight? and by 1974, i'd imagine that any performance advantage that a caddy or lincoln had over an imperial had vanished, as those monstrous 460's and 500's got smogged down."
4022,"May 25, 2006 4:11PM",jrosasmc,"you're selling your volvo soon? wow, how many miles does it have on it? that's a perfectly good car though.

my mom has a '99 s70 that has 72k miles on it and runs great. i myself have a '96 850 that ""only"" has 74k miles on it, which is really low mileage for its age, and it runs and looks like it came out of the showroom. we hope to keep both volvos well past 200k. by the way what year is your alfa again?"
4023,"May 25, 2006 7:04PM",qbrozen,"the volvo is gone. i sold it a few weeks ago. 116k miles.

my alfa is an '86. so just 20 years old now.

the volvo was great. it was just wearing on me. i guess i'm not cut out for having a miled-up car as my daily driver. i like my commuting car to be tight and quiet, and the volvo just couldn't provide that any more."

4025,"May 25, 2006 7:48PM",Mr_Shiftright,"the seller is a total dummy. the la forza has nothing to do with ferrari...he's confusing it with the lm002 from lamborghini. la forza has a pinanfarina styled body, but ford engine and iveco chassis. geesh.....i'm sure he'll get a raft of crap for that ad!"
4026,"May 26, 2006 4:39AM",lilengineerboy,"it is rare...i believe its more like a detomaso pantera in that it uses a domestic v-8 with ""italian"" styling. motor trend or road and track did an article on the car in the 80s and it was praised for its handling for an suv (remember this was circa '86 or so).
they pop up every so often and are also in hemmings from time to time. my guess would be the ""tlc"" stuff like interior and exterior trim pieces would be unobtainium, but mechanical pieces probably interchange with something else."

4041,"May 26, 2006 7:08PM",british_rover,"yeah any range rover is going to be out of most people's technical capablities. if you get one with air suspension which would be all p38s, mark iiis and classics built in the 1990's then just count on the air suspension having issues.

on the classics and p38's count on complete and total failure on a regular basis that will cost you a couple of grand a pop to replace all the bags. better off just doing a coil conversion and paying 2000-3000 dollars once.

really unless you are either a masochist or a rover nut, be advised these are many times one and the same, it is not worth messing with an old range rover.

if i could pick up a classic range relatively cheap, less then 1,500 dollars for example, that was either coil sprung or had been converted then i would buy one.

i could use it for promotions at the dealership and when it completly grenaded i would turn it into a pure trail vehicle."
4042,"May 26, 2006 8:28PM",jrosasmc,"yeah a good friend of mine just got rid of a '95 county lwb because it was giving him too much headaches. he didn't just ditch it- he donated it to another person because absolutely no one wanted it. and this was the reason: it had 175k miles on it, and i don't know how in the world that rover made it that far.

well since you're very mechanically inclined and knowledgeable about european products i'm going to have to ask you this one- do you ever work on modern volvos like, say, those from 1996 and up, and if so what is your opinion on them repair- and reliability-wise? i've got a '96 850 with only 74k miles which i absolutely love, but when i have to get it fixed it costs me a lot. i also have to say it's no 240 either...those cars were very simple and easier to repair. saabs i wouldn't touch with a 10-foot-pole."
4043,"May 27, 2006 5:52AM",qbrozen,"the trick is not to take your volvo to a dealer. find an independent mechanic who specializes in them.

the 850s are pretty reliable. as with any european, you just need to keep on top of it so you don't get buried in backlogged repairs. there is tons of info on the net at dedicated volvo boards to help you take care of just about anything on your own on that car."
4044,"May 27, 2006 6:28AM",british_rover,"agreed most of the basic stuff like oil changes and brakes you can do on your own. you just need proper instructions, the proper tools and to take your time.

once you feel comfortable with that then moving on to spark plugs and wires possibly valve cover gaskets or oil pan gaskets is not that bad either."

4056,"May 29, 2006 9:06AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah but those prices (and who knows if they even sell at that price) are for very special, over-the-top, modified/restored cars brought up to fanatical levels of perfection with staggering cost. they aren't even m5s anymore, really--i know what you're talking about, and that $30k car cost someone $40k to build, at least.

but this guy's m5 is just a stock car in nice condition. and having a black interior hardly justifies the ""only 156 made"", as if the color of the interior matters at all to value....of course that's sillly.

ditto the saab people---i've seen old 900 turbo 5 door hatches converted to rebuilt 5 speeds from automatics, with the newer 16valve engines installed, all kinds of handling, performance mods, special wheels, restored inside and out and underneath....basically a new and improved saab for 1/2 the cost of the new ones. so i can see the justification for the asking prices.

in the same way the marque fanatics worship on the altar of their gospels, and pay big bucks for their ""religion"", so to these same people can spot a false god and scoff at the wannabee who thinks his m5 or saab is worth the same as those of the anointed ones."

4066,"May 30, 2006 8:32AM",fintail,"haha if only.

i think 550 is about double a real world price. judging by the wheels and the seats, the car probably has no performance options either. still...i love looking at it."
4067,"May 30, 2006 9:15AM",Mr_Shiftright,"no i think you're assessment on the mgb is quite accurate, very good. the market for these cars is all over the place...mgbs seem to come in three basic flavors...1) patched up old rat not worth saving (2) amateur restorations to daily driver status with questionable modifications, and 3) full bore restorations that cost more than the car is worth. you just don't see ""survivors"" or original cars, and you rarely see really top notch work on these cars.

gullwing -- totally dingbat price. looks like $190k-225k car all the way, maybe $250k at a drunken orgy type auction, maybe $275k for a stunning restoration (you need to really examine these cars, especially to see if the tubular frame has been butchered). it also looks like an early model car. add $5,000 for belly pans. nothin' special about it really. these cars are always for sale it seems. what you really want is the 300sl roadster. it costs less, drives better and is way more comfortable inside.

i actually still have an original workshop manual for this car."
4068,"May 30, 2006 9:31AM",british_rover,"hmhhh got any directions to these drunken orgy type auctions???

ok about the mgb and just mg's in general i guess i have a couple of questions.

if someone wanted to build a mg for a little fun in the sun car that might see the occasional autox track or general track day...

1. what year/model would be the best one to pick?
2. should i stick with the original engine for simplicity sake?
3. if i decided to go with a modern engine swap what would be a good choice?

i would want to use a little 4 cylinder that has good power but is fairly common. what about a miata engine?"
4069,"May 30, 2006 9:46AM",stickguy,"if you want to go to all the trouble to engineer in a miata engine, just buy the miata engine in the first place.

probably for a bit there are kits for a v8 swap (not what you want for autox of course). i think shifty has mentioned seeing a mazda rotary in a b. that sounds neat if you can buy a well designed kit, otherwise not for the faint of heart. if nothing else, it should fit with room to spare.

if it were me, i would get a late 60's-early 70's chrome bumper car, so it at least has the more modern suspension (shocks)and will probably be a little tougher. i would also keep the engine, and add some easy to do go-fast parts (moss will sell you as many as you can afford). the bottom end on these things must be darned near indestructible."
4070,"May 30, 2006 9:46AM",Mr_Shiftright,"good advice!

there's nothing wrong with the mgb engine...it's torquey, tough as nails and if set up right will perform just as well as any 4. engine conversions just ruin mgbs, which are approaching collectible status. to do an engine swap would be borderline barbaric imho :p

you can build an mgb engine up to around 140hp for the track and there aren't too many modern 4s that are much better than that...of course that 140hp 1.8 engine won't be all that streetable.

best years...well, i'd say 1967 to 1974, but of course if you can avoid engines with air pumps all the better.

some people put webers on these engines but all they've done is spend a lot of $$$ to get 3 hp at very high rpm, and it sinks the gas mileage into the pits. hardly worth it.

aside from all kinds of engine mods you can do, you can buy more effective shocks and springs and many many other upgrades. the parts supply and modifications supply for mgbs are almost endless. aside from the old vw bug and the mustang, the mgb probably has the best aftermarket support in the entire world. anything you need for that car (even an entirely new metal body!!) can be delivered to your door ups in a couple of days....any part!"
4071,"May 30, 2006 10:21AM",british_rover,"ok that is kind of what i thought so i am glad it was confirmed.

keep the original engine avoid the smog cars and update all of the suspension compenents. i would put a roll cage in the car too to make my wife feel better. i doubt i would do too much to the motor besdes what was necessary to keep it running smoothly."

4075,"May 30, 2006 11:13AM",qbrozen,"so i went to check out that '81 f150 that was listed on ebay for $699.

i guess, for the money, it could have been worse. he did a full tune-up on it. it ran kinda rough still, though, but the tranny worked flawlessly.

the biggest issue is that he told me he replaced the steering pump to fix a leak. well, i had to let him know he replaced it for no reason because it was actually the steering box that was leaking. and nothing minor, either. i was actually watching the beads of fluid form and drop off the car. and this was before it was even running. i'd hate to think of the severity of that leak once it was actually hot.

anyway, i decided that my money would be better spent elsewhere. i've seen plenty of pickups in the $1k range. just gotta get out and starting checking them out in person.

there's a '65 f150 in the auto shopper, but the wife says we are buying a work horse, not a collectible that i'll want to sink money into. of course, she's right, but i'm still upset about it."

the thing is, that's pretty much unavoidable on these. its just a matter of, if it was repaired, when and how well? the rocker panels, trunk, and floor will all rust, without a doubt, no way around it (unless you find one that lived its whole life in the southwest, but then it will rust the minute you get it here). so, the trick is to get it for a price that compensates for getting the body redone. if its mechanically sound, it at least has something going for it. if you have a good body man that will do you a big favor, or if you can do it yourself (as was the case with my alfa), then you can come out ok on the deal if you are careful."

my feeling is--why not just buy a nice one ready to roll with no rust for $10k??

otherwise, unless you are handy with a torch and your brother in law owns a paint shop, i don't see the wisdom in this purchase.....well, if you could buy it for $3,500 and just flog it to death without fixing it, that would be fine."
4093,"May 31, 2006 9:36AM",andre1969,"where are these car shows where cars as poorly done and dirty as this one win the awards? trans am

i have a feeling that trans am owner won the same types of awards over the years that i have. people's choice awards in a class that's so subdivided that there just isn't a whole lot of competition.

for example, i took my '67 catalina to a pontiac show ages ago, and it won third place, i think it was. it didn't win anything for originality, restoration, or anything like that. car show attendees just thought it was cool and liked it, and enough of them voted for it on a ballot that it won something. fwiw, there were only a handful of cars in that particular class anyway!

my '79 new yorker won third place in its class at the mopar nationals one year. 2003 i think it was. its class? rwd stock mopars from 1975-1989. not really too much to pick from there! i think there were maybe 10 cars in that particular group that year. iirc, a '78 or so newport won first place, and i think a nice looking late 70's diplomat or lebaron coupe won second.

i was a little miffed though, because i didn't even know i won until the following week when the trophy came in the mail! i didn't even think to check the winner's board on sunday morning because, well, it's a $900 1979 r-body! i love them, lemko likes them, and maybe 10 other people on the entire face of the earth even know what an r-body is, so i just didn't think it would get much interest. anyway, if i had known about it, i could have been in the winners' parade that goes in front of the grandstand, and had my pic taken with my car and some scantily clad women in bikinis. probably wouldn't have been able to post it, with the way sneakers is. :p

i kinda like those smokey and the bandit era trans ams. the ones with the rectangular quad headlights, but before they sunk the grille openings down low in the bumper. i think they only did them that way for '77-78?"

i also believe that imperials around this time frame used the same roof for both the 2- and 4-door hardtop. as a result, i think the car actually looks a bit better in 4-door form, while the 2-door suffers a bit!

4112,"June 1, 2006 10:17AM",qbrozen,"well, maybe scam is harsh, but i definitely wouldn't have any confidence in bidding. what are you going to get for your money?

so it seems like you are buying an unseen citroen from overseas, that may or may not arrive in the near future, and may or may not be legal to drive on our roads. does that pretty much cover the deal?

i guess my big problem is that most scam deals involve wiring money to a place like holland (where this car is supposedly located). not to mention, the car is in holland, but the seller is in jersey, and the web address of the seller is canadian."

as for reserve prices, some of them can be pretty silly.

i found my '79 new yorker on ebay, and i forget what the reserve was, but i think it had a buy-it-now price of $2500 or $2900. well, i was the high bidder on it; i think i bid up to something like $725, but nobody hit the reserve. i contacted the seller, and we agreed to $900.

well, when i went out to look at it, it was actually at a little sales lot, and a sign for $1695 on it.

i think my '76 lemans had a buy it now price of $4500. i don't know what its reserve was either, but i think it got bid up to around $2500-3000 and didn't trip it. i contacted this guy too, and we agreed on $3000."

high reserves usually mean the person is fishing for a naive buyer (the old ""ebay is a gold mine"" theory, which isnt true), and then when no fish arrive, they run it again or close the deal privately. basically the ""greed factor"" is operative here. many of these ""deadbeat buyer"" complaints are, i betcha, from people who bid the car to the high reserve, told their friends, got laughed at, and kicked the deal."

there are a couple of cars where i can't pinpoint a stereotypical owner -

porsche boxsters - a lot of people call them girl cars, but in my area they are almost exclusively driven by guys.

minis - not necessarily girls cars, but known more as for effiminate guys (so to speak). i love them, but my wife says i am too big to look right driving one."
4129,"June 2, 2006 7:18AM",british_rover,"i have seen a lot of boxter owners and, sold several of them cars as well, and i agree can't pin down a type.

i own well owned a mini i just sold it and same thing can't pin down a type for them. you can see some trends though. regular coopers are more likely to be owned by women or men that are just past middle age. color really effects who drives the car. yellow mini coopers are almost always driven by when younger then 30.

mini cooper s models are about evenly split men vs. women but the darker colors like cosmos black, chili red(my car was chili red with black roof and mirrors) the old indi blue tend to be owned by men.

i am a fairly big guy too, 6 feet tall 225 lbs, and i never looked funny driving my mini.
the new hyper blue seems to be owned by more women.

i got some rover demographics too.

according to land rover discos were bought about 90% of the time by men and their average income was just over 100,000 dollars a year.

now i actually see who is driving these discos most of the time and in my opinion it is closer to a 50/50 split between men and women driving discos.

land rover obviously realised their mistake and has corrected it with the lr3 by making it a much more female friendly vehicle. you see this in who buys and drives them as i would say it is almost an even 50/50 split."

4139,"June 2, 2006 10:51AM",Mr_Shiftright,"fiberglas replicas often make no sense. as was mentioned, you can buy a real model a for less than you can build a fiberglass one using a 2.3 ford engine and an automatic transmission. can you say boring?

ditto the healey....geez, putting a 302 v-8 with automatic in an a-h kit car is imho ""unclear on the concept"". the a-h is nothing without a torquey straight six and an overdrive 4-speed transmission. and if you can spend $20k on a boring plastic replica why not spend $30k and get a decent real one (maybe not a show car, but a decent clean driver). i mean, you know that ah replica is going to drive like a rental car.

another downside of replicas are, i think, a) you will suffer the sneers and ridicule of anyone who knows the real cars, and you won't be allowed in shows with the genuine articles displayed and b) you will take a tremendous loss on your investment.

replicas spiral down in value to nothingness, except for the replica cobras, which spiral down slowly and bottom out eventually to about 1/3 their msrp value. i actually like the cobra replicas, because a) the real ones cost so much and b) the real ones were really kind of kit cars anyway.

so you can build a replica that looks like, performs like, drives like and sounds like the original. what's not to like?

believe it or not, that's how some police departments work when maintaining their cars. my uncle knows a guy who used to be a mechanic for some jurisdiction in virginia, and if something happened like, say, a valve went bad, they'd tear the car down, replace that valve. nevermind the fact that if one went bad, can the others be that far behind?

my uncle told me this story soon after i bought my '89 gran fury, an ex-police car, and had the impression that even if police cars get pushed harded, they're also maintained better.

btw, my '89 gran fury got retired from the city of richmond when the #8 camshaft lobe failed. supposedly that was a common problem with the 1989 318's. but what exactly happens one just one lobe fails? would it be enough to screw up the whole engine, or would it just run on 7 cylinders then, until you replaced the camshaft?

the place i bought my car from pulled a 318 out of a wrecked 1988 diplomat and dropped it in, but even here i'm wondering...wouldn't it be easier to just replace a camshaft, versus swapping in a complete engine?"
4141,"June 2, 2006 11:37AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah but a valve isn't a piston is the problem. a piston has to be ""weighted"" and balanced. one piston heavier than the others? all hell can break loose...nasty vibrations or worse.

you can swap in a new camshaft but you also have to replace the lifters and rocker arms, otherwise you'll just eat up the new camshaft real quick."
4142,"June 2, 2006 11:42AM",british_rover,"that is very very true of the virginia state police. my shop had the contract to do the very basic preventative maintance on their cruisers. they would not use any of our parts though we just did the labor which was just silly. they brought the cheapest no name oil and even that changed every six months as they found someone that would sell them the oil chaper.

one of the troopers told me that they had started getting the oil for as little as 20 cents a quart.

4151,"June 2, 2006 5:10PM",Mr_Shiftright,"'94 bwm 740il -- well, yeah, it woulc be worth $6,000 clean and running...with dents and a bad transmission, try $600 (ifyou're lucky). figure $3,500 for the transmission, $1600 body work and a few hundred bucks for this and that....and now you have an old 740il with 110k on it.....hmmmm....

'73 bmw cs -- he's asking $21.5k but the real world says about $12.5k should do it. maybe $15k at barrett-jackson with everyone drunk and stupid.

'82 audi coupe -- scrapyard

'70 camaro z28 --- all camaro sellers, repeat after me: ""it's the 1969 model that everyone wants"". shoot, for $29k you could buy a real 1970 z-28 in pretty fair shape.

86 crown victoria -- he wants $4,000, he should take $1,500 and run to the bank with it. as the sopranos might say ""you got nothin'!!"""

4153,"June 3, 2006 8:35AM",Mr_Shiftright,"there would be a w or an r as the 5th digit in the vin, so you might ask the seller what the vin is."

does get your attention.

no title and no keys no problem right?"
4155,"June 3, 2006 8:58AM",british_rover,"gto yes or no?

another gto"
4156,"June 3, 2006 9:00AM",Mr_Shiftright,"you know, that audi 5000s auction really says it all: a $50 asking opening bid and no bids on the car after 6 days.

mgb: eh, the car looks rough. notice the funky paint job on the underside of the engine hood, the lack of a ""groove"" on the rear splash pan between gas cap and tail light (we are in the bondosphere), also battery in the trunk, which can only mean the battery trays have rotted out under the rear shelf (common).

the problem here is that rust on an mgb is a devil to repair. looks like a ""beater car at a beater price""--fair enough!

bentley turbo r -- asking price is market correct, but man, you gotta be brave to buy a car like this...it could suck another $30,000 in the snap of a finger. punishing maintenance and repair costs scare most buyers. the rich don't want a used bentley and the poor who just scrape up enough to buy one as a wannabee, can't afford to take care of them....ergo, down the cars go in a death spiral to destruction....tough, tough sell but a mighty nice ride--these cars run like a freight train...5,000 or 6,000 lbs of hurtling steel....a classic ""gentleman's express"". but it's those $8,000 brake jobs...ouch!!"

4158,"June 3, 2006 9:10AM",Mr_Shiftright,"what makes that mercedes ""interesting"" to you?"
4159,"June 3, 2006 6:34PM",fintail,"wouldn't a 427/4 speed wagon be very rare and relatively valuable to a ford nut? i know the galaxies with that combo are worth big money. maybe it's a 428, but with a 4 speed in a wagon even it would be a big rarity and desired by an enthusiast. i suspect that car has been patched together.

the w108 is no rarity but looks pretty nice, price seems correct."
4160,"June 3, 2006 6:44PM",fintail,"i know it is way overpriced and a lost cause, but i've always liked these"

4162,"June 3, 2006 8:23PM",gsemike,"not really ""project cars"", but will probably be a project for the person posting the ad:

i would gladly pay 27 grand for a used cobalt

so you badly need a stranger to sell you a car on payments... and it has to be an 03/4 honda accord... coupe... in white. anything else that you want??

that ad is just bizarre

at $1,000, this one has two extra zeros

call the wrecker if they'll come

you don't see too many ads that list every oil change since 2000

fairly intriging 5 sp max

for $6500, he's not even trying to break even... could be a decent deal

most guys with cars like this post an ad that says ""over 20k invested.. sacrifice for $15k. for $6500, you could do worse if this is what you're in to

if this had a stick, i've had bought it already

frankenbird

it's a look alike of a car that was never made. could be decent but ad is a little short on the details

if it's got a brand new roller 350 and doug nash 5 speed, maybe. of course from the ad, it could just as likely have a v6"
4163,"June 4, 2006 9:11AM",fintail,"not many like these left...price could go down some

geez, for that price you'd think the dope could at least spell it correctly"

4165,"June 5, 2006 8:24AM",fintail,i thought hard drug use didn't come into fashion til the late 60s. nice steering wheel
4166,"June 5, 2006 8:38AM",andre1969,"i always theorized that chrysler made those plymouths look ugly on purpose so that people wouldn't mind spending a few extra dollars on a dodge dart!

and it must have worked, because the dart outsold the plymouths by a pretty wide margin iirc. plymouth as a whole still outsold dodge when you factor in the valiant (which they tried to market as a separate division that first year), but those funky '60 belvederes and furys must have been a hard sell! in addition to the dart, i wonder if some people just spent a few more bucks for a chrysler windsor, too?"
4167,"June 5, 2006 10:28AM",fintail,"i know back in the day my grandpa would spend a few more bucks and get a chrysler newport...he liked mopars in the 50s and 60s and had a few. he also had a couple nyers...he seemed to think they were a more tasteful better value competitor to a caddy, but they seem more upper range buick-ish when i look at them.

strangely enough, his last car was a caddy."
4168,"June 5, 2006 10:30AM",Mr_Shiftright,actually that very car stripped clean of most chrome and painted black looks pretty cool---i saw one recently.
4169,"June 5, 2006 10:44AM",andre1969,"i could actually see that, with the '61 plymouth. fwiw, i think most of the car's ugliness lies in the front-end; they actually don't bother me too much from the side.

it looks to me like starting in 1960, chrysler used the same roofline for both the 4-door hardtop and 4-door sedan models of cars. it's just that they put frames around the windows, and had a b-pillar that the door frames cover over, just like on modern cars. in '57-59, the hardtop roofline was lower and sleeker than the 4-door sedan. now, i guess this probably cut into headroom a bit. in 1960, they went to unitized construction, so they were able to lower the floorboards a few inches as well. in the '57-59 models, the floor was almost at the door sill level, but in '60 they dropped it down considerably, which also made the tranny/driveshaft tunnel more noticeable, but at least you weren't sitting practically on the floor!

i think it's kinda neat how on the '60 plymouth, the tailfin actually starts from below the beltline, instead of rising up from the beltline itself. i wonder if that's one reason the fin looks so gigantic?"
4170,"June 5, 2006 1:05PM",Mr_Shiftright,"the fins don't look gigantic, they are gigantic--lol!"
4171,"June 5, 2006 5:28PM",ghulet,"...i'm pretty sure you couldn't get more bang for your buck, at least attention-wise, than that '60 plymouth. the two-tone is especially fetching, and i love red interiors."
4172,"June 5, 2006 6:09PM",fintail,"good point...i mean, for 2 grand, and you could almost certainly go lower. detail it out yourself and touch it up...and it's a fun sunday cruiser for the price of a beater. it would get more attention than a new bmw. i like old cars like that."
4173,"June 5, 2006 8:16PM",gsemike,"isn't too bad. it's definately off-beat but don't think that i'd say ugly. only thing is, with a slant 6, how ridiculously slow would it be?"
4174,"June 6, 2006 12:12AM",andre1969,"that 0-60 in something like that '60 plymouth would be around 16 seconds. they only had 145 hp (in net terms about 110), but they also had the advantage of a 3-speed automatic (versus 2-speed for a chevy) and fairly aggressive gearing. and they weren't nearly as heavy as they looked; i'd guess around 3500-3600 lb.

it would be an okay cruising car. just don't try drag racing unless you could find an olds diesel or some other easy target from the late 70's or early 80's."
4175,"June 6, 2006 5:04AM",gsemike,"there would have been plenty of v8 versions produced as well, right? although nobody knows how many are left, there must be at least a few that came out with 426s?"
4176,"June 6, 2006 5:43AM",andre1969,"i'd guess that most of these 1960 plymouths just had the old 318 wideblock. it was a 2-bbl setup with 230 hp, and probably good for 0-60 in about 11-12 seconds.

that year you could also get a 361 or a 383. i believe both engines were available with a 2-bbl, 4-bbl, or ""cross ram"" dual quads.

there was also a 413, but in 1960 i think it was only used in chrysler new yorkers, 300's, and imperials, and hadn't trickled down to the plymouths and dodges yet, although it soon would.

there was also a package available for the 318 that boosted hp to 260, but i'm unclear as to whether it was a 4-bbl or dual quad setup. i don't think the dual quad setup actually increased peak hp all that much, but made more hp available across a broader rpm range.

as for the 426, i think it came out in 1962, and was used in those prematurely downsized dodges and plymouths, and was quite a screamer in those light bodies. the term muscle car hadn't been coined yet, but with the right engine/tranny setup, these things would put many so-called musclecars to shame."
4177,"June 6, 2006 7:06AM",british_rover,i don't know that merc just looks interesting to me. no particular reason.
4178,"June 6, 2006 8:42AM",lemmer,"how much for this '82 380sl?

come to think of it, for the same money i will take this z3. they are getting pretty cheap."
4179,"June 6, 2006 9:11AM",Mr_Shiftright,"the v-8 sls in the old body style are generally acccompanied by the comment woof woof! but i'd say the most you could hope to get would be about $8,500 for a really sharp 380sl. anything over that is a gift from god. clumsy gas hogs with blood-curdling repair costs is about the story on them. but there is the ""look rich for cheap"" factor which tempts some people, at least until reality sets in.

z3--the price does seem to be a bit of a bargain, but the miles are scary for a used bmw.

if you want a really cheap z3, try for the little 1.9 (??) four cylinder models."
4180,"June 6, 2006 9:36AM",andre1969,"a little truth in advertising? i actually kinda like it, but for $3500 i'd expect something like this to be in very good condition, and not needing body work."
4181,"June 6, 2006 9:52AM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh dear, the seller is way out of touch here on market reality. he'd be fortunate to get $750 for it. a 4-door 70s car with rust? get real."
4182,"June 6, 2006 10:04AM",fintail,"if you want a 107, get a 560sl. i'd pass on a 380, especially a higher mileage one with spoke wheels."
4183,"June 6, 2006 10:05AM",Mr_Shiftright,mercedes look awful with spoke wheels i think. pimps 'em out.
4184,"June 6, 2006 10:14AM",fintail,"i agree

although they were actually an approved dealer-installed accessory on earlier w111 coupes. i saw one that had them from new. it wasn't so bad...but somehow, i like the body color hubcaps."
4185,"June 6, 2006 10:21AM",lemko,"many rust spots coming through amateur restoration? this car is dead. my dad had a 1972 ltd. when rust gets these early '70s fords, it's curtains for them! my dad's car looked like mice ran through the body by 1981 whereas grandpop's 1974 chevrolet impala was still as solid as if it were machined from a solid billet of high-quality steel."
4186,"June 6, 2006 11:00AM",qbrozen,"if you want a really cheap z3, try for the little 1.9 (??) four cylinder models.

interesting. the only reason i would consider that posted z3 is because its the 2.8 model.

imho, the 1.9 should never have been made. the z3s running around with that engine gave them a bad image. i can't count the number of times i heard someone say ""that new bmw convertible is cute, but its so slow!"""
4187,"June 6, 2006 11:07AM",lemmer,"no slower than a contemporary miata. the only problem is that bmw wanted an extra $10,000 or so for their car."
4188,"June 6, 2006 11:10AM",qbrozen,"exactly!

it looked sporty and expensive ... but only succeeded in actually being expensive."
4189,"June 6, 2006 11:15AM",lemmer,"i could still be talked into one if it was cheap enough.

problem is, much like 318s and such, the poseurs keep the prices pretty close to the six-cylinder models."
4190,"June 6, 2006 2:57PM",Mr_Shiftright,"people who can't drive a stickshift probably...one never hears that a 1998 miata is ""so slow""...any engine that is a bit light on torque requires a good driver."
4191,"June 7, 2006 6:10AM",qbrozen,"well, again, i think its perception. those who don't know (ie, 95% of the buying public) don't expect much out of a miata (mainly given its price)."
4192,"June 7, 2006 6:42AM",lemmer,"it has been a while since i have seen an svx in any condition. i know they had a small cult following, but they never really did anything for me.

mr. rover guy out there seems to like these defenders. this guy in my town always seems to have a couple around, usually on ebay.

i know nothing about '41 cadillacs or luxury hot rods, but this one seems overpriced."
4193,"June 7, 2006 7:21AM",british_rover,"be interesting to see what the defender goes for. i always know people in the market for those.

the svx looks a little flaky. why part out a running car that seems to have a straight body? unless you are making a substantialy larger amount of money which maybe he is i don't see the logic."
4194,"June 7, 2006 7:33AM",lilengineerboy,"if you want a 107, get a 560sl. i'd pass on a 380, especially a higher mileage one with spoke wheels.

i agree. 380sl was not the finest moment. i would go older (450sl) or newer (560sl) but not such a 380 fan."
4195,"June 7, 2006 8:14AM",qbrozen,"but i found it in my favorites. maybe someone here posted it before, i'm not sure. anyway, its free to sign up if anyone wants to take a look. its interesting to ponder the vehicles. imagining what happened to them, etc. some are pretty obvious, but i have a hard time understanding how some get totalled. there is either alot of hidden damage or special circumstances (theft recovery? how long does a car have to be missing to get your insurance to pay it off?).

http://www.ridesafely.com/

there is one ferrari there (in nj, no less) that looks completely undamaged in the pics. too bad the bidding is up to $130k last i checked."
4196,"June 7, 2006 8:34AM",andre1969,"i kinda like the older ones, but not that '92. it was a style that, when it came out, had a futuristic look to it. but by the time it was restyled, and other cars were starting to catch up, stylewise i guess, it just lost its uniqueness, and that window treatment started to get a homemade look to it."
4197,"June 7, 2006 8:36AM",british_rover,"hmhhh wonder if i could find a decent track car. getting a salavaged car legaly registered in ct is a pain in the [non-permissible content removed], unless it was repaired in ct and even then it is a lot of work, so it would probably only be worth it for a track car."
4198,"June 7, 2006 8:42AM",qbrozen,"interesting thought ... but then you'd have to trailer it all the time. kind of a pain, too, unless you were planning on that in the first place.

i like the 6-series bimmer in my area, too, but the extent of the damage is quite scary. i believe bidding was up to around $30k. i'm not sure how anyone can come out of that rightside-up for $30k plus the cost to fix it."
4199,"June 7, 2006 9:37AM",fintail,"resto-rods can be cool, but that caddy is a joke at 100k...look at that dash, talk about cut rate."
4200,"June 7, 2006 9:56AM",qbrozen,"heck, i think the dash is the least of its worries.

they pulled parts from old junkers to put it together! a '76 caddy engine? rear drum brakes? good grief. even high-end resto rods with brand new custom crate engines and all new modern suspension, brakes, electronics, etc, don't go for $100k. many don't even go for $50k."
4201,"June 7, 2006 9:59AM",british_rover,"that is where my tdv8 bi-turbo lr3 comes in with about 300 horsepower and 550 lb ft of torque. i think that will make a perfect two vehicle/trail rig.

4202,"June 7, 2006 10:00AM",qbrozen,let me know when it arrives. we might lease one for my wife.

sounds like there's a johnny cash song in the making there!"
4204,"June 7, 2006 10:09AM",british_rover,"the new euro spec range rovers are getting a 272 hp twin turbo v8 with 480 or so lb ft of torque. i doubt it would take much to bump it up to 300 hp and 550 lb ft of torque. just a little tweak to the turbo software is all i hope.

i just pray that lrna does the right thing and puts this motor in all three rovers currently coming to the us. bump the output on the range rover version 10% over the lr3 and range rover sport but otherwise keep it unchanged.

on the european mileage test this turbo motor averages around 25 mpg city/highway combined. imagine that a nearly 3 ton suv that gets better then 25 mpg on the highway with no electrical assistance."
4205,"June 7, 2006 10:17AM",lemko,"the 1941 cadillac is perhaps one of cadillac's greatest design and one of the best car designs of all time. i don't know about $100k, but $50k would be about right for an excellent original or precise, well-executed restoration on a 1941 cadillac convertible. the convertible sedan would be even more desirable.

that idiot should be fined $100k for ruining such a classic car! oh gee, let me buy a bugatti royale and put in some '70s gm hvac controls and a tacky aftermarket radio and a super-stupid steering wheel! first of all, the instrument panel should be woodgrained not body color."
4206,"June 7, 2006 11:09AM",andre1969,"my buddy who has the mark v fetish just sent me this ebay link. i guess with only 17 miles on it, it's probably one of the nicest in the world. but jeez? what do you do with a car like that?! you almost couldn't even sit in it, let alone drive it, for fear of breaking something."
4207,"June 7, 2006 11:17AM",lemmer,"did they put 17 miles on it driving around in a parking deck or a big warehouse as it has never been driven on a street?

why won't the seller reveal the vin? isn't that a key piece of information for someone interested in such a car?

i can't imagine it is good for anything other than a museum, but i also can't imagine many people would want to look at it if it was in a museum.

i wonder how much money the owner would have now if he had invested the price of the car in the stock market in 1978. not to mention insurance and storage costs paid in the last 28 years."
4208,"June 7, 2006 11:23AM",qbrozen,"well, the trick will be meeting the new emissions standards. lots of extra equipment is needed on the diesels. i hope the majority of manufacturers bring them out sooner than later."
4209,"June 7, 2006 11:24AM",qbrozen,"i'm speechless.

just another example of how there is a buyer for every car, i suppose.

it could very well be the best example in the world ... but i, for one, would not pay anywhere near that price for it!"
4210,"June 7, 2006 11:30AM",andre1969,"i have kind of a soft spot for these cars, but i'd have a hard time parting with $18k for one. i don't care if i have the nicest one in the world or not....heck i'd buy my buddy's ""beater"" mark v for $3-4k and just have fun with it before i'd pay $18k for something that i'd be afraid to touch.

there were a couple of mark v's for sale at the ford nationals, and a couple didn't seem too badly priced. the only thing is, for me to get a car like this, it would have to be very specific. i'd want the 460, a sunroof, and an attractive color. i could live without the sunroof i guess, but i'd think a 400 would really be a dog in a car like this. and as for color, on something like this i think it's really make-it or break-it.

on some cars i wouldn't be nearly so picky about color. for instance, it would take a really grotesque color to make me thumb my nose at, say, a '76-77 lemans, '61-62 caddy, '79-81 mopar r-body, '57-59 desoto, '72 impala, etc. guess i'm just weird like that!"

nice color combo, 402 big block, probably not too smoggy. according to a '72 standard-sized chevy brochure i found online, the 402 had 210 hp standard, or 240 with dual exhaust, which this one appears to have.

i always wondered...how come they'd always call the 402 something else? earlier versions were still called ""396"", while the '72 brochure lists the 402 as the ""turbo-jet 400"". the smallblock 400 was ""turbo-fire 400"".

these things came stock with a 2.56:1 rear end, and used the chevy 305-4bbl with 165 hp. would changing the rear to a 3.42:1 really do much for this car? on one hand, it would let it rev up a bit quicker, but then on the other, wouldn't the tranny simply up-shift that much sooner?"
4215,"June 7, 2006 12:52PM",qbrozen,"oddly enough, i like that one, too.

is this horrid mustang really worth the high bid? when i was in high school, you could get a pile like this for close to free if you would haul it off.

i guess this must be market price for hopeless mustangs."
4253,"June 9, 2006 7:17AM",andre1969,"i look at the '67-69 style as being kind of the '55-57 chevy of darts, but later ones never really interested me as much. i do like the style of the '70-72 though, especially that '72 front end, which i think has an aggressive stance to it. the '73-76 models just started getting too busy in styling though.

i do think the dart was about the best compact of the 70's, although i guess that's not really saying much. i think one reason is that in the 70's, most new designs ended up being worse than the 60's designs they replaced. and since the dart was relatively unchanged through its end in 1976, it didn't get that screwed up. most of what was wrong with it was bolt-on stuff like wimped-down carburetors, heads, emissions controls, etc...stuff that could easily be swapped out for older mechanicals.

i think 1972 was also the last year that the slant six was a halfway decent engine, giving a good balance of power and economy. that year it put out 110 hp (145 gross), although california versions were smogged down to 100. in '73 though i think it dropped to 100, and soon thereafter went as low as 90-95. by 1977 it took a 2-bbl carb to get it back up to 110 hp, and with the cars that were offering it, you were probably better off just getting a 318, which took better to emissions controls, and was also a better engine for the heavier compacts of the late 70's.

i wouldn't mind having a '72 dart hardtop with a 318. 150 hp, 265 ft-lb of torque, and i don't think they started messing around with overly tall axle ratios yet.

as for that riviera, i do like that '95-99 style. every once in awhile i'll check autobytel and traderonline for them, but i dunno if i'd ever actually spring for something like that. at this point i think i'd rather have something that's only a couple years old, or old enough that i can get historic plates for it (currently 1981 and older)"

4256,"June 9, 2006 10:55AM",andre1969,"that riviera. i think black-over-silver looks really sharp on a car, and downsized late 70's cars usually had the angles and creases to pull it off with some dignity.

4257,"June 9, 2006 11:44AM",lemko,wasn't it said that buying a 1976 dart was like buying a new 1965 car?
4258,"June 9, 2006 3:17PM",andre1969,"wasn't it said that buying a 1976 dart was like buying a new 1965 car?

yeah, lemko, i read that in some consumer-type magazine from 1975. i forget the name of it, but it wasn't cr. i think it was called ""consumer's digest""? anyway, they compared a 1975 dart to a 1975 granada, 1975 nova, and i forget what else.

the line they used was something like ""this dart is almost more like a well-preserved 1965 model than a brand-new 1975 model, but with way cars seem to be progressing, that's not as bad as it sounds!""

and to be fair, a 1975 granada was really just a heavily facelifted maverick, which dated back to 1970. and the nova, while it looked modern for 1975, was still riding on 1968 underpinnings.

i think the nova probably had the advantage of slightly better handling, and its base 6-cyl was larger, a bit torquier, and took better to emissions controls than the darts slant six. and since the dart coupe was a hardtop, i'm sure the nova was probably a bit more solid-feeling.

but on the minus side, i think novas rusted out quicker, and while their interiors were more modern looking, they weren't as roomy, and didn't have as much luggage space. and in v-8 models, the 318 was usually a better performer than the 305, although you could get a 350 in the nova. in darts, i think the only way to get a 360 was to get a dart sport 360, and that was almost overkill, making a car that was ready to embarrass corvettes, trans ams, etc.

as for the granada, i think the only thing it really had going for it was a top-notch marketing team that was able to convince buyers that they were buying a mercedes-type car at flea-market prices. i don't think they were really all that unreliable for the time, but most 50's cars handled better. and the transmission on my grandparents' '77 did fail. i think the 250 inline 6 was probably as bulletproof as the slant six, but emissions controls hurt it just as bad. and they were pretty cramped too. now all 2-door cars tended to be cramped back then, but model-for-model, the granada was worse than the nova or dart."

4268,"June 11, 2006 3:16PM",andre1969,"the slowest car sold today in the usa is the civic hybrid at 0-60 in 10.3 seconds.

where are these stats coming from? i can think of several cars that take longer than 10.3 seconds to get from 0-60, like the taurus/sable with the vulcan 3.0, or the chrysler 300/dodge magnum with the 2.7. iirc they're pushing 11 seconds. and the ford focus, if it still offers that base 110 hp 2.0, is probably around there.

now if you look down some road test digest in the back of mt or c&d, you might not find anything worse than 10.3 because they didn't test it. i just did that, and the worst i could find was a toyota prius, at 11.2 seconds, last tested in 2004. fwiw though, they have the civic hybrid at 10.8 seconds."

4274,"June 12, 2006 8:39AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well this ""first year"" porsche 911 is a case of: ""yes, it's rare, but does anyone care?""

i have no idea how flukey cars like this go in an auction. i think his asking price is preposterous beyond words. i mean, yes, a very early 911 would be a nice collector piece in a larger 911 or larger porsche collection; however, the early 911s are pretty terrible to drive....you know, the ""first year"" blues and all that.

maybe if it were the first one every made, yeah, you could sell it for a big price and ship it to the porsche museum. but there's no indication that this one is #1 or #2, etc.

another issue here that has to be addressed is that this 911 is an entire unibody car...if it is rusted where the suspension points are attached, and where the body attaches to the floorpans, you can just about junk the thing--it will never be restored and only a lunatic would try. so that's a big if here as well.

considering that you can buy the identical car as a 1965 model in spectacular condition for probably $18,000, and as a decent clean driver for #12,000, i really don't see where this $65,000 is coming from and who would care to own it at this price.

real value? probably no more than the opening bid, if that.

at least it is the older 240 hp engine, so it shouldn't be as high strung (or expensive) as a new one.

just remember to hang on if you punch it in the wet. i hear they are a handful (easily able to overpower the old style rear suspension).

if i got one to keep, and i had the $$, i would look into some rear suspension upgrades to stabalize the handling. i assume there are kits available."

i see your point about the z car too. it would be a hard choice for me. of course, i would consider spending that $30k on a ferrari 308 that can barely keep on with a late '90s accord v6 or an old porsche 356 that can't keep up with a new corolla."

yes, even in those days i had odd tastes. that, and i was already subscribing to a number of the car magazines by that age!"
4285,"June 12, 2006 12:51PM",Mr_Shiftright,"it could be worth $35,000---$40,000, because it is unmodified.

most panteras come in three flavors: 1) beaters 2) pimped out, over the top modded cars that look and drive like a wild beast and 3) properly and expensively restored cars.

so finding an original (if it's true) is going to be very attractive to buyers.

the car isn't my cup of tea because the italian styling, interior, etc. just clashes with the sound of that truck engine behind your ears. somehow it's like two different worlds that don't go all that well together.

exactly. its one thing to build a straight-up muscle car like the cobra. and its another thing for ford to build a supercar. but i just have this mental block about these kit cars built with components from 12 different countries. maybe it would be exotic if someone in sweden had a pinanfarina designed car with an amg powertrain, but as soon as you take a run-of-the-mill 351 ford, 350 chevy, or what have you, it loses a bit of its status, imho.

should it even command original musclecar money? well, what does a decent cobra replica fetch? somewhere in the $20k range? what if it was a cobra replica that was 30 years old? would that be worth any more? i seriously doubt it. so, to me, this is a used kit car. the only thing i think of when i see the name pantera is a bad '80s hair band of the same name."

now you just cannot drive a ferrari a lot but he does put a couple of hundred miles a month on that f430. as long as there is not real snow and ice on the ground he tries to get it out and enjoy the car."
4291,"June 12, 2006 1:37PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i think the biggest problem with amg cars is the resale value---very nasty downside.

as for the ""m"" cars, historically at least the engines have not been particularly long-lived...but that could have more to do with how they are driven (one would hope)."
4292,"June 12, 2006 1:52PM",lemmer,many of the recent amg cars have really tame styling compared with some of their predecessors - and i mean that in a good way. maybe that will help with resale in the long-term.
4293,"June 12, 2006 2:09PM",fintail,"the resale value is a good thing if you're like me (and i assume most of us here) and don't buy the cars new. let someone else eat it. i think something like my c43 is/was a relatively good value for the performance and even exclusivity. and it is pretty stealth, which is a good attribute. insurance and fuel economy are acceptable...take care of it and it won't hurt you.

the days of the strange blackout cars and strangely colored cars (purple amg w126 sedan anyone?) are gone. amg is mainstream now...heck, it's even just an appearance package somewhat.

and about driving the cars...it's a shame when money overrules sense and modern performance cars sit idle. like that porsche...they are meant to be driven, they take mileage easily. or the local house i know of that has a s55 and a sl55 perpetually in the driveway...they rarely move and are often covered in dust. on the flipside, there's a guy i see almost every day apparently commuting in a current model aston. now that's cool."

""standard instrumentation""
standard for an aircraft? a boat? a speak n' spell? what the hell is standard???

4331,"June 15, 2006 1:22PM",andre1969,"i'm guessing that this thing has no trunk to speak of? at least, it doesn't appear to have a decklid. also, the part about where the passenger-side door drops down like a ramp, while interesting, doesn't seem too practical. first off, wouldn't that scuff up the paint or dent it? not to mention that the door panel material then becomes your ramp, and is subject to foot traffic. can't be too good for the vinyl/leather/whatever. also, you'd better make sure you're not parked too close to the car beside you, because with a door like that, there's no such thing as opening it just a little bit!

i also don't like the fact that the car has no top. that gives me a bad flashback to a 1975 olds cutlass sedan i saw at carlisle years ago. i remember seeing this thing from a distance, with no roof, and thinking cool, they made a convertible out of it! wrong! what they did was chop off the roof and the b- and c-pillars, and then put some kind of trim pieces over the holes. they also had to put a brace in the back seat, connecting the lower part of the b-pillars to brace them up for the rear doors. and since that brace had to accommodate the travel of the front seat, it really killed back seat legroom. and since the rear door windows didn't roll down all the way, they just took out the glass.

it was actually a sharp looking car from the outside, but totally useless unless you just wanted something to drive around in nice weather, put in a parade, etc. but there are better-suited cars than a chopped 70's sedan. this car just struck me as ""incomplete"". and that's how this top-less custom gray '42 desoto wanna-be thing strikes me. ""not a complete car"""

4340,"June 16, 2006 8:54AM",Mr_Shiftright,"mgb 1980 -- i'm not sure why anyone would even want such a car, but if you must have the worst mg ever made, i'd say around $4,000 would be more than enough to bid on the blind. if it isn't trashed or screwed up and is clean enough, you should be able to dump it for that once you realize what a horrible mistake you have made.

verdict: only if cheap but ask yourself why before you bid.

65 dodge coronet -- giddely overpriced by more than double. rust of this dimension is an enormous and expensive hassle, and when you're done, you've got---a '65 coronet....yippie/zowie.....

you could find a rusted chevy ss impala convertible for this money and at least when you're done, you have something.

verdict: no way"
4341,"June 16, 2006 9:37AM",lemmer,"my '77 mgb had been put back to pre-rubber bumper height by the prior owner, a friend of mine. he also did some minor upgrades to the suspension it was rebuilt. all told, all the suspension work cost around $2,300.

there was also some minor engine upgrade work done to it by the owner prior to my friend (including the notorious webber carb). all the emissions stuff got lost in the process. i don't know how much this cost.

for the price of the upgrades and the car itself, there was likely more money in it than a decent chrome bumpered car would have cost.

i bought the car in 1992 for $2,000 (good friend deal, the car was worth probably another $1000 or more). i drove it for almost two years. in that time, the paint started spider webbing, the top developed 2"" stress tears on either side, and i dislocated the front bumper trying to tow it with a my dad's full-size chevy truck. (why did those fine engineers attatch the tow hook to the bumper on the extreme right of the car?)

i sold it to the dean of the business school for $1,000 cash and his pristine '84 jetta diesel that i sold for $1,700 a month later. after he had it for a year, he accused me of ripping him off and selling him a piece of junk (but he wasn't mad). he unloaded it in further decrepit condition to a graduate student for some unknown amount."

there's a local guy here who used to have a '68 dart convertible that he bought used back in high school, like in the late 70's/early 80's. he also has an early 60's lincoln continental (closed sedan, not the convertible).

well, back in 1993 i asked him if he'd be interested in selling that dart. it didn't run at the time, but i had my excellent-running '68, and figured that between the two i could try to piece together a decent-running 'vert. let's just say i was a bit more optimistic back then.

unfortunately, he'd already promised to give it to someone else! i ran into the guy a few years later and he said he wished he'd have given it to me, because he knew i'd appreciate it. it turns out that the guy who bought it fixed it up and tried to sell it back to him!

now that my '68 is now sitting back towards the edge of the woods with 338,000 miles, hasn't run in a few years, and, to put it nicely ""needs tlc"", i've pretty much gotten darts out of my system. still, i think a convertible one would be cool!"

4358,"June 18, 2006 8:23PM",fintail,"andre - the dart was a 64 gt, 318, pushbutton auto, needing cosmetic renovation but it looked pretty decent in the pics, and had been cared for. it was likely a good little rig to pick up on the cheap.

on the way, i spotted a car for sale. i'm pretty sure it's a pontiac, but not sure of the year or model. perhaps if i describe it, someone might recognize it and post a picture for confirmation.

what i can tell you is that it is a two door convertible (green with green roof), very large (bonneville?) and looks to be an early 70's vintage. the most distinctive feature i can describe - as i was driving past at 40mph - was that the tailights curved down as they got to the outer edges of the car. sort of like this:

------)
)

i know it's pretty lame to try to replicate this with keyboard characters, but maybe it's enough to go on.

it had a $5500 price tag on it."
4360,"June 19, 2006 7:22AM",andre1969,"sounds like a '67-69 catalina or bonneville convertible to me. all three had taillights that curved down at the outer edges. the 1967 taillights only curved down a bit, to the top of the bumper. the 1968 taillights curved down further, into the bumper, and had gave it kind of an exaggerated, awkward look that didn't seem as well-planned out.

in 1969 the taillights were a bit smoother and more integrated, and the trunk lid dropped down between them. also, in '69 bonnevilles had a body-color panel on the rear bumper, while the catalina had none. i had a '69 bonneville, but i really can't remember if that trim piece was hard or not. it may have been soft at one time and just hardened with age?

the 1970 pontiac rear had taillights that were linear, integrated into the bumper, and were spear-shaped at the outer edges. then from 1971 onward, pontiac just went to generic, rectangular taillights that got bigger and gaudier as the decade wore on."
4361,"June 19, 2006 9:40AM",michaellno,"you da man! i knew you'd come through for me. of the three pictures, i think that what i saw was the '69.

so, what kind of engines did these beasts have? is $5500 a reasonable price. from the quick glance that i had of it, it seemed to be in pretty decent shape, but i'm sure that once i get close, it'll have more issues than monica lewinsky in therapy."
4362,"June 19, 2006 9:56AM",Mr_Shiftright,"$5k--$9k would be the range for '69 bonnie converts in decent shape. but they shouldn't need lots of work at those prices. if it needs paint or has rust, deduct accordingly."
4363,"June 19, 2006 10:10AM",michaellno,"the paint seemed to be in decent shape - but again, i was travelling at 40mph and was several hundred feet away. i'd have to go out there and give it a closer look.

4364,"June 19, 2006 10:58AM",andre1969,"i'd imagine that bonneville has a 400-4bbl, which i think put out about 330 hp by that time. most of them most likely came equipped this way. a 428 was available, which my old car book says put out 370-390 hp. there was also a mild 400-2bbl that was tuned to run on low-octane gasoline, with 265 hp that was available as a credit option. i'd imagine though that something like this might have been more common on a cheaper car like an executive or catalina, but probably rare on a bonneville.

my '69 bonneville felt pretty quick...when it was running, that is! it had a strong appetite for starters. i've been told this was actually a common pontiac problem, and they were known for getting cranky when you'd start the car hot. almost kinda like the starter had a dead spot on it. this car had been struck by lightning though, so i'm sure it had some issues that went beyond any idiosyncracies of the engine!

i don't know if radial tires would have been standard on a '69 bonneville, but mine had them, and it was an excellent-handling car, especially for its size."

one thing that looks kinda odd to me about this free one, is that it appears to sit up kind of high. almost like the engine has been pulled out of it. but then, these cars did sit pretty high to begin with, not low-slung and weighted down like many 70's cars appeared to be."

i'm partial to mid-60s gms boats like this, and pontiacs were the prettiest, especially 'sporty' versions with buckets/console, and i like the fact that it's unmolested (even with plainish original hubcaps), perfectly unperfect with a bit of patina, and reasonably priced:

but then, i did go to chicago once to look over a 1974 travco motorhome which, thankfully, i came to my senses once i saw it in person. and i did go to ohio for a '76 lemans!

sometimes, some nice 70's or 80's cars show up in the car corral at carlisle. often they're overpriced, but sometimes there seem to be some pretty reasonable deals.

when the day comes that my intrepid finally calls it quits, i've thought about just going back to driving cheap used cars. or just buying newer used cars that are 1-2 years old might make sense too. but i've gotten myself into a cheap enough mood that i doubt i'll ever buy another brand-new car again."

he said part of the fun with it is that he can blow off mustangs with a 4-door sleeper. i dunno if it's really that fast or not, but this guy does have a gift for hyperbole. i dunno if he's experienced any mechanical problems yet, but i'm guessing he will.

as for that tarted-up, bustleback fairmont, for some reason i kinda like those. it is interesting that, around that timreframe, the big three all tried that motif. cadillac did it first with the '80 seville, and then chrysler with the '81 imperial, and then lincoln with this continental.

if i wanted some neoclassic-style 80's domestic that was nice and heavy, but not all that big overall, i'd still probably just go by that old standby, the m-body 5th avenue. even though their origins are humble, being based on the aspen/volare, if all you want is something cushy and plush and luxurious in a louisiana cathouse/fredericks of tijuana sort of way, they were easily the equal of anything cadillac or lincoln was putting out at the time."

i think i'm one of the few people who really likes 'squarebirds', though i know they're pigs (handle and brake poorly, love gas, feel huge yet have no room)...that one looks nice, and the fact that it has manual windows is kinda nice from a maintenance standpoint. i think that's one of the cars of that era on which power windows, being optional, were more common than manual. i'd still rather have one with the 1960-only factory (manual) sunroof, but those are a bit hard to find, and command a fairly serious premium."

sometimes you can ""hand-sell"" an interesting car by spending a lot of time with just one buyer and slowly convincing him of the merit of paying three times book price.

4431,"June 26, 2006 9:56AM",andre1969,"what the seller meant by ""fuel sensor"" on that fury, as well!

as for that camry, i liked the part where the seller mentioned that it's fast compared to modern diesels. umm, aren't modern diesels actually pretty close to their gasoline counterparts in acceleration? my consumer guide has a 1985 camry test, with the 4-cyl/auto, and it did 0-60 in about 13 seconds, which was about on par for a car like that back then. about equal to a k-car or cavalier or maybe a stanza, but a bit slower than an accord (this book lists about 11-12 seconds), but much quicker than a tempo (15.9 seconds for the topaz in this issue). but back then, didn't your typical car diesel take about 20 seconds to get to 60 mph? now this book also listed a 1985 benz midsized (300e?) diesel at 0-60 in about 12 seconds, but then benz knew how to do a diesel!"
4432,"June 26, 2006 9:59AM",Mr_Shiftright,i'm sure this car drives like a dog. to this day no one makes a diesel as refined as a benz.

http://www.barrett-jackson.com/auctionresults/common/cardetail.asp?id=181053"
4452,"June 27, 2006 6:32AM",lemmer,"good points.

the scm price guide has the following values for the mgbs in #2 condition, so those sales look spot on.

1962-1967: $12,000-$17,000
1968-1974: $10,000-$15,000
1975-1980: $ 5,000-$10,000

i get the feel this is probably a #3 car, so i am going to stick with the $8k number until shifty sends me down in flames.

the seller is motivated as he is retiring downsizing, and moving out of state, but i doubt he would be sufficiently motivated by $5,500-$6,500."
4453,"June 27, 2006 6:35AM",qbrozen,"is the difference between #2 and #3 really only 20%?

what are the descriptions of cars that meet these levels? (i've never looked at scm)"
4454,"June 27, 2006 6:35AM",lemmer,"edsel pacer. who are these appraisers that give such high values? are they giving market values, agreed insurance values, top of the market pie in the sky values or what? if the car is really worth $6,500, why take much less? if it is not worth $6,500, why did the appraiser assign that value."
4455,"June 27, 2006 6:41AM",lemmer,"""we assume (the cars are in) strong #2 condition, with no stories attached. in other words, it has the original or near-original drivetrain, and is in very good physical condition in and out with no glaring faults.""

the high and low ranges are supposed to be ""hope to buy for"" and ""hope to sell for"" ranges.

i haven't seen the car yet, but i think with a $100 or so spent on ebay and a few hours of detail work it should easily be a 3+ car."
4456,"June 27, 2006 8:09AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i'm with gbrozen on the mgb--there are some troubling things about this car that justify a $6,500 price.

the fact that the crank was not addressed in the rebuild means that we have a crankshaft with over 100k on it, and on an mgb that should mean a rebuild coming up soon enough, or at least new main bearings and a polishing of the crankshaft.

it is most unfortunate that a weber has been put on the car. i really do not believe for one minute that this car gets 30 mpg with a weber, unless it has been jetted so lean as to be risky. the sus are wonderful carburettors, and the car's originality has been compromised as well.

the master cylinder is a devil of a job and costly.

the broken odometer is no biggie but again, you have to pull the head out and have it rebuilt because the little gears have stripped out.

it's a nice car but it's not a fresh restoration and it needs a quick $2,000 bucks probably. we have new tires to buy + master cylinder + odometer + something with the oil pressure gauge + we have the old crankshaft to sweat with a new top end to pound on it.

i'd also have the car lifted before buying it, most definitely.

so yeah, $6,500 --$7,500 seems like plenty generous. for $10k-12k, you should be getting a no excuses car. after all, this is an mgb. they made one half million of them and most of them ended up here, so really now, this is nothing rare.

and let's step back here for minute. here's a guy who spent all this time on an ad, told you his family history, and he's trying to sell a car for top dollar with brakes that go to the floor when you drive it. what does that tell you?

appraisals: well sometimes an appraiser will be generous for insurance purposes. appraisals aren't meant to be used as sales tools, they are meant to protect the owner. the appraiser (if he's any good) states right there in his appraisal that his appraisal is no guarantee whatsoever that the car will realize this price if sold.

i always ask people why they want an appraisal and if it's to know real world value i have another product that is cheaper and more sober.

all cars have a range of value....there's no ""one number"", and if for insurance the appraiser places the car on the high end of the value (without getting silly about it), i have no issue with that.

real value of that edsel? geez, looks like $3,000 is all the money."
4457,"June 27, 2006 8:46AM",lemmer,"i would be in trouble without my daily reality check here.

saturday, i am going to look at the car with my friend and i will adjust the offer based upon the fine advice i have received from you and qb."
4458,"June 27, 2006 8:46AM",fintail,"it was probably ""appraised"" by some shady antique dealer who doesn't understand how to grade a car, and who also cons old widows and mourning families out of their estates. i think a lot of this stuff exists out there. it looks ok, so it must be a #2 at least, right?"

this car is interesting...the bench seat is very rare, i've seen it only twice. they were mainly used on universals and commercial vehicles. special order maybe. and the wheel arch trims are unusual too, i've never seen that style. period aftermarket accessory maybe...they are not like the trim on a 300se."
4463,"June 27, 2006 11:05AM",Mr_Shiftright,"you can see immediately how much more a car this '72 is than the last one. first of all, the goodies that have been added; then the overdrive transmission, which really really transforms the roadster into a car capable of driving on modern highways. and of course the original su carbs, the electronic ignition, etc. there is a lot of value packed into this car.

still, $14k seems too much by maybe 10-15%. i'd have to see these ""blemishes"" to price it more accurately.

gt coupe-- actually a much better car to drive than the roadster, although a bit slower due to extra weight. the coupe windshield is taller, giving you a less claustrophobic feeling than the roadster with the top up. and the gt has a handy hatchback (world's first!!) where you can stuff a lotta things into that little car....more than you'd imagine. also most gts came with overdrive, a must on an mgb if you don't want to be droned into delirium on a long trip with top up. and much cheaper than a roaster to buy! what's not to like?"
4464,"June 27, 2006 11:07AM",andre1969,"my understanding is that the chrysler enforcer was a cop car offered from 1961-64 with a 383 v-8. dodge started going more after plymouth, chevy, and ford in 1960, as opposed to the larger cars like mercury, olds, and buick, and as a result their longer wheelbase cars started to trickle up.

the chp had a minimum wheelbase requirement back then of something like 121 inches. plymouths only had a 118"" wheelbase, although i think the wagons were 122"". the 1960-61 dart was also on a 118"" wheelbase.

for 1962, chrysler shrunk all the dodges to a 116"" wheelbase, along with the plymouths, and suddenly none of their cars were anywhere near the needed wheelbase for a chp car. so that year, only the chrysler, on its 122"" wheelbase, would qualify. in mid-year though, dodge did come out with the 880, basically a newport with a 1961 dodge front clip.

a '62 enforcer should have a 383 though, not a 361. the 361 pretty much became a dog-motor after 1960, being offered mainly just as a 2-bbl carb model with 265 hp in the newport, dodge 880, the final desotos, and optional in some of the plymouths and other dodges."

next toy might be a black 914 targa punched out to 2.2 liters. it's got a super clean, rust-free freshly painted body, good upholstery and tires, and the engine and clutch will have been thoroughly and professionally rebuilt. trying to close the deal for $8,500. i've had 914s before and they can be fun. they are great handling cars."

i was in college in maryland and a guy i knew named tim came back from a break with an older mercedes 4 door, i think it was one of those that didn't change styles for a long time, a boxy sort of sedan from the 70's. it wasn't too much later he stuffed 4-5 rugby players in it and was coming back from a game when the left front wheel suddenly ended up shoved up inside the wheel well and the ride came to a halt. they got it towed to a rural shop and the mechanic put her up on the lift and came out shaking his head, ""yep...that's what frame rust will do to ya!"" seems the unit-body, altough flawless on the exterior was pretty rough on the underside and the car was a complete write-off because there was nothing solid to attach the suspension to."

issues - three hail looking dents, hood/trunklid. scratched trunklid from antenna. ac condenser blew two weeks after i got it home ($800 total). had a bad steering clunk, lubed up the iss myself, pita but $0. now, after commuting in it for a while its starting to leak quite a bit of powersteering fluid. didn't look like it coming from the rack, but we'll see. for now just adding fluid.

i got a paint estimate for clear coat repairs of $600 here in texas, which is pretty cheap.

also, although the car is pretty nice inside, i got some of that sound-deadener stuff on-line and was thinking of seeing how quiet i could make it, but has not been a priority like the other repairs.

not bad for $5k, but some issues and a dead brand, limited resale, but when i finish with my cars, they are well used.

yes, you can find those types, driven hard and put away wet and they have lots of ""deferred maintenance"". my intrigue was a one-owner car, and had all receipts and religiously had fuilds changed. what he didn't do was clean the engine compartment at all - it was so disgusting i nearly didn't buy the car after traveling to get it (that and a few other surprises), but an adjustment to the price helped a lot. some serious cleaning got it ship-shape now.

this car is amazing, is solid, rides firm and handles well, much like an import like mercedes, and the dohc motor revs freely to redline, a rarity for a gm motor, 4 wheel disks, etc.

on the drive home from buying it i got 33, 31, 30, 29 mpg (speed enforcement decreased as temperature increased and i started running the ac). it doesn't need to kick down for hills, the style still looks reasonably up to date (my neighbor thought it was an acura or something).

i'm pretty happy, but we'll see how the power steering repair goes. if i have to replace the rack, so be it. keeps me out of trouble. wife says ""how come you don't like maxima? wait, i know, you don't get to work on the maxima as it doesn't have any problems!"" (wife is smart cookie lol)

4501,"June 28, 2006 9:51AM",andre1969,"there's an old saying that one mile of wear and tear on a police car is equivalent to two on a regular car. so a 106,000 mile crown vic copcar is roughly equivalent to a 212,000 mile civilian model.

i dunno if that's true or not. i had an '89 gran fury that had been a sheriff's car for richmond, va. it only had 73,000 miles on it when i bought it, but its engine had been replaced, a 75,000 mile 318 pulled out of a wrecked diplomat. it really wasn't a bad car, although it did eat starters. and a fuel pump, two power window motors, and a distributor. it also needed new valve cover gaskets, a new front gasket, and a new rear main seal (or whatever that gasket that makes it leak out the back by the tranny is called). i got the front seal and valve covers done, but the rear seal wasn't leaking that bad, and would have been prohibitively expensive.

that car also needed a new radiator and freeze plug. evidently someone ran good old fashioned straight water through it at one point. it got crappy fuel economy around town, like maybe 11-13, but surprisingly got 20+ on the highway. i thought that was really odd, considering its epa rating was a horrible 13/15.

in the end, the water pump went bad on it, and i quit driving it. then i discovered that a lot of its parts were a direct swap onto my '79 new yorker. it's gone now, but its wheels and two of its power window motors are now on my nyer.

it made it to about 118,000 miles when the water pump went out and i'm sure would have gone further, but i was just tired of it and it was one car too many.

shifty, what kind of police car did you have?"
4502,"June 28, 2006 9:52AM",british_rover,"the bump does not necessarily mean turbo. all talons had bumps.

i think turbo talons were tsi trim levels but i just can't tell from that picture. i need to see the back to be sure cause the wheels just aren't enough to tell.

for the eclipse the two trims you wanted were either gs-t for a turbo fwd car or gsx for turbo awd."
4503,"June 28, 2006 10:24AM",qbrozen,"huh. ok. i'll take your word for it. i always thought (someone told me at some point, i'm sure) that the bump was to make room for the turbo. and i suppose that could still be true, but the hood came on all cars.

yes, tsi is the turbo, and tsi awd was also available."
4504,"June 28, 2006 10:27AM",andre1969,"that bump was on the hood to make room for the turbo as well. or am i thinking of those first-gen ford probes, where they had to put the bumps to make room for the strut towers?"
4505,"June 28, 2006 10:29AM",qbrozen,"ok, you guys have sufficiently talked me off the cliff."
4506,"June 28, 2006 10:34AM",british_rover,the turbo was actually mounted just under the exhaust manifold in the front of the motor. the bump i think is actually to clear the top of the cam gear cover. if that was done so that the motor could be pushed up and back so that the turbo could fit in the front i do not know.
4507,"June 28, 2006 10:36AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i had a dodge diplomat police car. a friend and i went halfies on it, and we rigged it with a light rack and magnetic decals (you can never drive these on the street without a lot of signage that says movie car--usually we trailered it) and we rented it out for tv and commercials. i have a photo somewhere of me dressed as a cop driving it.

we should have put down the top to make some of this less noticeable/more bearable, but i don't think he ever puts the top down. i suspect he is too afraid he might get a slight crease in the top."

its like those folks who pop up on the ""engine swap"" discussion asking things like ""how do i swap a v8 into my v6 camaro?"" ummm... here's a tip. sell your car and buy a z28 to start with. cheaper, eaiser, more reliable, and ultimately faster."
4525,"June 29, 2006 7:05AM",Mr_Shiftright,"my rule of thumb to anyone who asks me about modifications is that 10 to 15% of msrp is plenty to spend and stop right there!

the logic of it is that one could justify a 10-15% add-on to the price of the car in used condition, because this is essentially what the price guides or ""blue books"" do for options or improvements. the 8 cylinder version will be worth that much more than the 6 cylinder, or ac + alloy wheels + leather = 10-15% more, etc. etc.

i'm modifying my car but i'm cutting it off at about $1,500 bucks. that's it no matter what. and i'm sticking to things that really improve the car, that's another rule of thumb. even my ""keep cool"" seat covers actually do something--a) protect the seats and b)allow air circulation under your body. and they look nice."

4545,"June 29, 2006 11:28AM",british_rover,yeah i had always heard the story that on the 3000gt the first time they shut the hood on the prototype they screwed up a measurment and punched holes right through the sheet metal with the shock towers.
4546,"June 29, 2006 11:39AM",Mr_Shiftright,"it's really hard to express how bad the xj6s are. one must stand in amazement that they were ever able to sell them. there are so many engineering defects i could fill this page. here's just a part of my repertoire--- the rusting ""saddle bag gas tanks"", the need to drop the entire rear suspension to service the rear calipers, the chronic fuel line cracking and leaks, the chronic overheating, the defective rack and pinion steering, the rusting back windshield areas, the high failure rate of the automatic transmissions (which can't be rebuilt, you just throw them away)---it goes on and on.

the bmw 735 is an outstanding car, probably the best bmw ever made imo.

true story: friend of mine some years ago inherited his mom's mint xj6, a 1982 i think...and in two years + he had put $14,000 into it. true he was fastidious while mom was not, but still.....

4549,"June 29, 2006 12:10PM",qbrozen,"its ok. post was just yesterday (i think ... i lose track of time).

i hate to be picky... but ... the bump on the wrx is actually an intake scoop to get air to the intercooler. on the evo, the intercooler is behind the front bumper, so the air scoop on that car is pretty much for show (although i suppose you could argue it helps keep the engine cool).

as far as the dsm bump, i think british_rover may have been more accurate when he said it was to clear the timing gear. the cams themselves would have nothing to do with this, but the gears that drive the cams, yes. and i did find some pics on the web that seem to support this. you can see the timing gear cover sticks up above anything else in the engine compartment and right around where the bump would be located on the hood."
4550,"June 29, 2006 12:33PM",lilengineerboy,"yeah, i didn't see his post until after i posted mine. the sohc engine doesn't need as much room to clear the cam gears. one would think given the simplicity of the 8v motor it would be easier to change the timing belt, but, eh, its not.

4552,"June 29, 2006 12:46PM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh i was thinking that the 735 had a good long run, had that great 3.0 liter engine, and boasted good longevity records. maybe i should say ""best bmw large sedan"" for overall sturdiness. just my opinion on that one, no real data to back it up.

it's unfortunate really, that some of the most awful cars are the most seductive and some of the best ones are kind of dull.

4563,"June 29, 2006 4:55PM",Mr_Shiftright,"you stick with me bumpy and i can help you rationalize anything to do with cars.

xj6 -- nah, a chevy v8 doesn't fix anything, because the jaguar engine is the best part of the car---what people think they are doing is not what they are actually doing, which is throwing out the electrical system attached to the engine rather than merely disconnecting it from the engine. (""baby with the bathwater, etc. etc"")

i think the reason the xj6 is so unreliable and difficult to deal with is that jaguar was an undercapitalized company. so the rear suspension, for instance, comes pretty much out of an e-type, as does the engine, etc. but that beautiful body is wrapped around some real cockamammie engineering, let me tell you. how many people use the ac to cool the gasoline? or use dual fuel tanks in a luxury sedan? or run rubber injection lines under the intake manifold, next to the block? aye, aye, aye.....

yes, that particular early borg warner transmission, which was i think maybe a bw66 (???) is really a bad piece of work. you can count on early failure. later transmissions were better, and later xj6s were better, but of course ""better"" is a relative term, as in ""better kind of root canal"".

the best you can do with these cars is buy the best one, a mint one, and try to blunt its inevitable mechanical disintegration. sometimes with luck, money, and a good mechanic, you can decelerate the tragedy to the point where the car is only marginally painful and on some days actual quite pleasant to own.

as one jaguar mechanic said to my friend on his first visit: ""you will have some nice days with this car, and you will have some very bad days with this car""."
4564,"June 29, 2006 5:05PM",stickguy,"just curious, but were a lot of the frightenling expensive repairs lagely labor cost instead of parts cost? say, something like the caliper could be a $2 seal that takes 5 hours to get to.

if so, it could make a decent project car if you have the time, skill and tools to do the work yourself.

of course, a new tranny is going to cost no matter who puts it in..

i was thinking about peter egan and his stories about rebuilding his e-type coupe. i imagine that if he spent say $20k on parts and farming out work while making it a diy, it could run an easy $60k if you paid a shop to do the whole thing?

that's another problem with something like the xj6. it isn't something likely to be owned by a real hands-on person, and as they age, they get ignored until they break."
4565,"June 29, 2006 6:10PM",fintail,"i wonder how many they made like that one in the ad

another reason he hated this car most likely is because it was an automatic, and back then he really preferred a stick shift. back around that time, he also had a '63 impala ss409, the 425 (iirc) hp version. so compared to that, i'm sure he really hated the ford!"

4595,"July 1, 2006 4:50PM",andre1969,"stashed in the engine compartment, that thing is definitely infested with some kind of rodents. years ago, my grandma had a mouse problem in her house. i had lived with her for awhile, but in 1999, after getting my finances back in order after a bad divorce, i was able to move back into my condo. however, i left a bedroom set at her place, in one of the upstairs bedrooms, and never got around to pickup up alot of my stuff. well, the bottom dresser drawer suddenly started filling up with dogfood! and i'd find some stashed in some of my old shoes and boots that i left over there.

in addition to the bedroom set and other stuff, i also left my two dogs with grandma, because she got too attached to them. we kept their dogfood in a big bin in her back room. so evidently the mice were raiding it and stashing it in various places around the house. they also had a habit of stashing it in the shower stall in the basement.

as for the poo, thankfully they didn't do that in my dresser drawer or shoes! but they sure dumped alot down in that shower! thankfully, in a place where it was easy to just wash it away. at least they were thoughtful little critters in that respect. :confuse:"

in many respects, your implication is correct, as saabs - like most volvos - are not maintained properly. it's always how the car was taken care of that's important. i have two mid-80's classic saab 900's, one an 8-valve 5-speed sedan, and the other a 16-valve 3-speed b-w automatic hatch. both are still daily drivers and each has over 175k. neither has suffered a transmission failure, nor head gasket woes. except for headliner replacements and the very common dash cover vinyl cracking problem, the cloth seats, and the remainder of the interior, are in excellent condition. also, neither engine uses any oil between the 3k or 3 month oil changes.

regular drain and refills will provide long service on the 5-speed, and the same with the old b-w 3-speed automatic - along with not abusing the transmission! most important on the head gasket is to use only the phosphate-free and ph buffered mercedes-benz coolant with distilled water, drain and refill every 24k, and change out the stock radiator thermo-switch to one from a vw to switch on the fan at a lower coolant temp. if you know the tricks, you can eliminate most of the bugaboos of owning a classic saab. yes, they can somtimes be finicky, but i've had fewer major problems with either of the two saabs that i've had with the other cars in our family ""stable,"" and these include some newer highly regarded asian and domestic marques."
4598,"July 2, 2006 8:31AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well i think the point is that giving a car to americans which requires special coolants and very meticulous maitenance is giving the car a death sentence. ferrari owners know how to take care of a car with 'special requirements', but your average american driver doesn't.

saabnet puts head gasket failure on the 4 cylinder turbo at 8%, which is abnormally high for any factory defect.

i don't mean to beat on saab particularly, as i always liked mine (i had 3). but they were all real pains in the butt.

volvos seem more amenable to abuse for some reason.

naturally, since old volvos and saabs are worth very little, as they age they get even worse maintenance from their 2nd and 3rd owners. mgbs suffered a similar fate, as did alfas.

at least with a ferrari, bmw or benz, you tend to find them in better shape as they age, since they have better resale. this is my theory anyway, that there is a direct correlation between the blue book price and the condition you're likely to find a car in when it's old."

i always love, too, when sellers want you to take two heaps for equal to, or more than, the price of one decent example, as is the case with the 633s (i want the seller to show any 633 that has sold for '$6000 easily' in the last two years). invariably, they have one with a fabulous body that doesn't run and another, older, beat-to-hell example with a 'great engine' that, inexplicably, barely runs....from which you're supposed to remove the engine and put it in the 'nice' one? $3700 would be a gift. you could spend less than that, probably find one nice, running 633 or 635 and have your neighbors not hate you."

i know i was really wrong on that last mgb, but this one seems worth the opening bid to me. i know the engine swap likely hurts the value, but it seems like a decent idea to me.

4632,"July 5, 2006 6:23AM",qbrozen,"restored to british standards

hmmmm... reading that sent a chill up my spine. so it can't be a good thing.

an mgb with a ford v6? for $8900??! uhhhh.... ummmm.... maybe shifty will have more constructive things to say. you know what mom says ... if you can't say anything nice ..."
4633,"July 5, 2006 6:25AM",andre1969,"i saw another b that was advertised as restored to british standards. what does that mean?

i think that means they squeak, rattle, rust, leak water, look like they were pounded together with sledge hammers, and have electrical nightmares aplenty to ensure your mechanic will have a very comfortable retirement. sorry, couldn't resist. :p

as for that one with the ford v-6, at first i was thinking duratech or vulcan or essex 3.8. but who knows? that little 2.8 v-6 was designed for small, lightweight cars, and was used in the german capri and the pinto wagons, so it might not do evil things to the car that a bigger v-6 or a v-8 would."
4634,"July 5, 2006 7:12AM",stickguy,"actually looks kind of nice to me. but, it also depends heavily on how well the conversion was done (cooling system, etc). the 2.8l used in the capri, pinto, etc. certainly was developed for small cars, and may not weigh much more (if any) than the standard i4. heck, they fit the buick/rover v8 in there, and it doesn't look too crowded in the engine compartment.
'
of course, only on a british car could you advertise ""german reliability"" as an upgrade!

for comparison, in the latest r&t, a dealer in nj (the stable, they seem to have 4 ad pages in the back of every issue with some real neat but overpriced stuff) has a brg '67 listed. all restored to a high standard according to them, sounds like it was done right, and may be one of the nicest you will find, probably better as new.

but, asking 22k for it!"

4640,"July 5, 2006 9:01AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah well i share your curiosity but the svx is a ver-y pricey car to repair. they are interesting though. too bad they are porkers in weight and only come in automatic. i drove one and liked it but it had an awful lot of push during aggressive driving. thank god for the awd at least. pricey parts on a car worth nothing isn't a good situation to be in unless you ""buy the best for cheap"" to begin with.

mgb/ford v-6: the pictures do tell the story and it doesn't read like a fairy tale. the engine compartment looks like a cobble to me, with mismatched heater hoses, corrosion, etc. not something that ""so and so racing"" should be so proud to put their label on. my vote? an abortion of a car. note also you can't seem to see the join line in the rear splash below the trunk (next to the backup lights). that means bondo. and look at how tall the gearshift is!! you'd have to shift with your forearm. and nice crusty brake drums behind the fancy wheels. carelessness all around is all i see here. i mean, why take out an engine that's simple and cheaply rebuidable for one that isn't and that you can hardly find parts for? makes no sense to me. what am i missing? i bet the mgb engine blew up and he looked around the back yard, and there under a tree was.....you guessed it!

the only mgb engine conversion i ever liked was a mazda rx-7 rotary conversion, because it was interesting, beautifully done, and the car ran like a bat out of hell. the owner wanted a high revving engine that could run ac with room to spare.

mgb people will hate the mgb v-6, but the 7 or 8 remaining capri v6 enthusiasts in america will love it and still not bid on it.

4658,"July 6, 2006 6:55AM",andre1969,"for a bried moment, al bundy actually drove (well,pushed) a pacer!

iirc this was an episode where he sold his dodge for a new mustang convertible, but then the dealer took the mustang back and i think had already disposed of the dodge. so he kept going out looking for cars and pushing these loser-mobiles back into the garage, usually accompanied by an appropriate tune such as ""welcome back baby, to the poor side of town"".

i think he also got stuck with a hornet or a gremlin. then finally, at the end of the episode, you hear the radio playing ""i'm walkin', yes indeed i'm talkin'"" as a '72 or so duster pokes its nose into the garge. but then as the whole thing comes into view, al's actually driving this one!

they always referred to al's car as a dodge, but on various times that they'd show it, i'd always remember a duster. several dusters, actually. seemed like they had several they rotated through for the car shots. and i do remember one of them being a gold duster.

one of my favorite lines (but probably not fintails) was when peggy said something like ""when i saw your dodge, with a book value of fifty bucks, slice through that $100k mercedes like a hot knife through butter, it made me proud to be an american!"" :p"

i never cared for them, because they were just a tarted up granada and it shows, where in contrast a seville doesn't really scream ""nova"". i like the color of that '77 though. and i like the thinner roofline. later models tried to bulk up the c-pillar in the same fashion that chrysler did in the 80's with the 5th avenue.

i remember that episode - al had $5k buried in the back yard that he was planning to use for a payment on the mustang but when he went to go get it peggy had found it and spent it all.

the punch line was that after the lineup of beaters he ended up buying his same old ""dodge"" back - hence the radio presents being the same. when peggy pointed that out to him his response was something like ""of course not - my old dodge had 99,980 miles on it, and this one has 12"".

my sister lives in herndon, so i have been visiting that area for many years. real nice, just got pricey, although the housing market (for sales) has cooled off a bit lately. at least there are a lot of appartment complexes in the area. and traffic!"
4722,"July 10, 2006 7:15PM",british_rover,"same v8 used on all gas land rovers up untill 2002 and used in the discovery untill 2004.

never really solved the head gasket problems with that motor."
4723,"July 10, 2006 7:22PM",Mr_Shiftright,dog of a motor but constantly developed and improved into something useable. a testament to the longevity of mediocrity??
4724,"July 10, 2006 7:33PM",british_rover,"yeah pretty much. it actually worked pretty well for the discos during the last two years. had plenty of torque at a fairly low rpm which is important for off road use.

from what the techs tell me is that if you take the crank from the 3.9/4.0 liter v8 and swap it into the 4.6 liter block you get a much more powerful and more reliable engine with a wider power band.

hmhh but maybe it is the other way around. 4.6 liter crank into the 3.9/4.0 block. anyway whichever way it works out the engine is much better that way."
4725,"July 11, 2006 8:21AM",qbrozen,"'63 buick - can someone explain to me why some folks take pics of their interior through the glass, rather than open a door or god forbid open a window? i've seen this a couple of times recently and it makes me think they are selling a car that isn't even theirs.

on another note, just a couple of days ago, my wife was saying she misses our little brown kraut. well, as fate would have it, someone down the street from me put their 2.3 190e out for sale yesterday. i know nothing about it at this point other than it is white, looks pretty clean, and has a front spoiler on it that my 190 didn't have (but i don't think its as pronounced as that 16v one that was posted here recently).

i'll stop by on the way home tonight and take a closer look."
4726,"July 11, 2006 9:26AM",Mr_Shiftright,"if you had a 190e and had good luck with it, then your good luck bank account is now empty. buyer beware says shifty (holding out two cents).

car photo gripes:

1. taking a photo of a car from 600 yards away

2. no photos of undercarriage

3. photo of engine shot at a shallow angle, so all you see is the top of the battery and one valve cover

4. mention of rust but never any photo of it"
4727,"July 11, 2006 10:00AM",fintail,"is it a 2.3 or a 2.3-16? i'd take the latter much faster.

my old mb specialist has an interesting 190e. it's a 5-speed 1993 sportline. but...it has an engine transplant from a 300ce, so it's a bit faster than the normal 190e. kinda neat little car."
4728,"July 11, 2006 10:01AM",fintail,"i can deal with bad photos on craigslist...i have to consider the venue. but on ebay, there is no excuse. sadly, the pics on ebay are often no better than craigslist.

4730,"July 11, 2006 10:22AM",fintail,"or pictures taken in some grimy old garage with about 2"" of room on either side of the car, so you basically get a picture of the rear end.

or on the same note, any pic of a car sinking into the ground due to lack of use, where the ad raves about how it runs and drives.

no pic, but one for shifty...hahahahaha"
4731,"July 11, 2006 10:27AM",fintail,"kind of an andre-mobile

""rare"" feature, but probably not a good one. also overpriced by about 10x, from what i can see.

restored ponton...cool, but slow. really slow."
4732,"July 11, 2006 12:25PM",Mr_Shiftright,"chevyporsche928-- actually i have no objection to the renegade conversion, since the original car had a v8 in it. not sure about the wide tires, though. the car handled great as it was. the price seems optimistic however. note the comment about the stunning 80s era german ac.

volvo 122 automatic -- delusional pricing. try $400 as a parts car.

mercedes ponton: cute little thing, but bazongo pricing. try $9,500 and be grateful for it. can you even drive this thing on a freeway without risking your life? nice ""ice cream"" car for the kids on sunday however.

yet another ""convert to biodiesel"" ad. you too can enjoy hauling 100 lb drums of used cooking oil into your garage for filtration and chemical treatments. yippie! or you can pay $4.00 a gallon for it at the pump.

gee, take your bike to work one day a week and accomplish way more with way less."
4733,"July 11, 2006 12:33PM",qbrozen,"wait a sec. i thought the 190e was considered very reliable. at least, that's what alot of owners seem to think on the message board i found.

anyway, i wouldn't say we had good luck with ours, necessarily. i didn't have it for very long, and it quickly developed a leaking head gasket, which i could not fix with my tools (if anyone knows how the hell to use a pulley puller in the 4 inches of space between the pulley and nose of a compact luxury car with a straight-6 engine, let me know). i sold the car instead. i believe i wrote about it here ... or maybe ccba. i forget."
4734,"July 11, 2006 12:47PM",Mr_Shiftright,"bingo! bad head gasket....welcome to the 190e club.

those people must be lying (just kidding). a 190e is in my book a very risky car and its reputation is not good ""on the street""."
4735,"July 11, 2006 2:38PM",lemmer,"i thought the 300e was the reliable one.

i had a college girlfriend with a 190e - it blew a head gasket one day when i was driving it."
4736,"July 11, 2006 3:12PM",fintail,were these failures mainly on 4cyl cars? was it a design flaw or something to do with not using mb coolant? i've heard the latter takes out old 6cyl head gaskets.
4737,"July 11, 2006 10:25PM",Mr_Shiftright,"the 190es were just trouble from one end to the other. probably right up there with a renault lecar and hyundai excel. it was probably benz's worst car ever in its 100 year history, imo. your results may vary of course."
4738,"July 12, 2006 5:03AM",andre1969,"which benz it was that focusmatt had? he hasn't posted around here in a few years now. for some reason i want to say it was a 190-something, but i think it had a 2.6 straight-six in it? does that sound right?"
4739,"July 12, 2006 6:00AM",lemmer,"i was speaking of a 4-cyl 190e. in mercedes's defense, i doubt it was religiously maintained."
4740,"July 12, 2006 7:13AM",qbrozen,"there is a 190e 2.6. that's the one i had.

well, we didn't get to stop and check out that 2.3 one for sale. we both worked late, blah, blah, blah. in any case, my wife came to her senses at some point last night and said ""well, i guess we really don't need it and if we do get another car, it should be a pickup, like you said.""

mx3 5-speed"
4751,"July 12, 2006 10:52AM",Mr_Shiftright,"914s -- okay, the one car is a typical 914 abused neglected worthless rat, so forget that.....the 914/6 is a clone with some bad taste bodywork. a genuine 914/6 is quite rare and fairly valuable (for a 914 i mean) and a handful to drive...with all that power and a mid-engine layout, you'll spin faster than a top if you get careless.

shifty's 914 -- yep, i have a deposit on a car that's being built. i get to decide on it (first right of refusal) when it's done. it's black on black with a very built up motor, probably to 2.2 liters with special pistons and cam. pricey at $10k but all restored (to a nice street standard) and rebuilt by a pro. 914s are great fun and still formidable in x-cross and scca racing.

alfa gtv 1974 -- well this car is obviously set up for vintage racing, so at $13,000 i'd say it's a very good buy if that's what you want to do with your time. you couldn't build a vintage race car for $13,000. it'll be sold in a red hot minute imo.

mercedes 300te 4-matic: the good news is, if the car isn't a scam, is that it is priced about 1/2 retail; the bad news is that it is a 4-matic, which is notoriously troublesome. however, this one did go 200k, so either the seller has a pile of repair orders larger than the manhattan phone book, or he's had better than average luck with a worse than average model. might be a good deal, check it out.

mecedes 190sl -- looks like your typical 190sl piece of junk. well, do the math. you can buy a stunning one for $30,000--$35,000, and you ain't getting from that to a #2 car for $8000 + $22k budget in restoration. actual value? depends on where the chrome parts are. the 190sl grill missing on this car is the exact same grill as on a 300sl gullwing. do you want to buy a new one of those? i don't. why anybody wants one of these cars is a total mystery to me--it's just a 4 cylinder mercedes 180 sedan underneath, that's it. a sheep in wolf's clothing.

audi 80 -- audi bottom ends (crankshaft, etc.) share the same remarkable durability as the saab 900, but both cars also share the same remarkable lack of durability in every other part of the engine. 500k miles without a rebuild? only in your dreams.

63 falcon -- might be worth buying actually, but the words rust and 'door hinges' in the same sentence sends chills up my spine.

""and the door hinge's connected to the door frame, and the door frame's connected to the frame rails, and the....""

'92 benz -- hey, sometimes a car beats you up so bad you just have to get down on your knees and beg!"
4752,"July 12, 2006 10:57AM",qbrozen,"d'oh! i skimmed right over the 4matic part of that ad. i was just so excited to see a benz wagon of that vintage at that price. ugh. i'm not interested in the added complexity of awd on a luxury beater.

ok. i guess, like you said, if you want a vintage racer. i guess that's just not my thing. i mean, i like racing ... but i like my classics as original as is possible and practical. (unless we're talking an all out hot rod that's basically 95% nonoriginal.)"
4753,"July 12, 2006 11:01AM",Mr_Shiftright,"yeah, the gtv as it is built isn't a street car. it'd beat you up. but vintage racing is quite popular and generally not viciously competitive (if you touch another car in the race, you're out for the year). it's a very pleasant way to blow $500--$1,000 a weekend (unless it blows up) and you're on the same track with million dollar cars. so unless you want to ""win"", it's pretty cheap fun, and alfa owners are great sports. of course a lowly gtv will not get you invited to prestigious vintage races or re-creations."
4754,"July 12, 2006 11:05AM",qbrozen,"i've often thought of taking the spider to the track. sure, its slow, but it does take turns pretty darned well.

i'm just afraid it wouldn't take the abuse at this point in its life."
4755,"July 12, 2006 11:12AM",Mr_Shiftright,you'd have to at least pass the technical inspection. some vintage racers just loaf around the track and have fun. you don't have to beat the car to death--but you do have to stay out of people's way.
4756,"July 12, 2006 11:47AM",fintail,"that 4-matic te does seem cheap, even for a model so notorious for failure. if you have record of maintenance or replacement...might be a worthy gamble. iirc 4-matic didn't get sorted out til many years later.

4760,"July 12, 2006 12:20PM",Mr_Shiftright,"it's not ""way below book"" though. maybe way below fantasy book, but it's spot-on private party retail...well, maybe a few hunnert cheap.

by the way, my friend and i are headed to tallahassee to see two early '70s mgbs on the 22nd. they are both priced at $14k, so they better me pretty close to perfect or be prepared to deal on price. (one is the modified blue one from ebay that i posted a few weeks ago.)"

4771,"July 13, 2006 7:32AM",qbrozen,"i'm feeling like $8500 is pretty accurate for this one if its all there (maybe $500-$1k high). really would need to get my hands on it, though, and check it out thoroughly. that's the problem with trying to figure out the value of a classic car by pics and description alone. it could be worth more than $8500 or it could be worth significantly less.

shifty would point out that, as usual, the seams are missing from the back panel, so you need to sniff out the bondo and find out what is going on there.

'66 is not a great year, as it still had the non-synchro 1st gear transmission. so if there's any noise in 1st gear, you can be sure you're in for an $$$ repair bill. door fit sucks, too, engine compartment restored with spray can.

4784,"July 14, 2006 5:50AM",lemko,love the 1970 chevrolet impala custom. my uncle daniel had a beautiful dark blue one when i was a kid. i loved how chevrolet did the taillights in the bumper from 1968 through 1970. i like the '70 design the best.
4785,"July 14, 2006 6:23AM",andre1969,"that i never really cared for on cars was when they did the little peaks between the headlight bezels on cars. big oldsmobiles were known for this in the early 70's, and i think the big '73 dodges did as well. however, even though the '70 impala does it too, i still think it's a beautiful looking car, and incorporates that little feature flawlessly.

did they offer the 1970 chevy with hidden headlights? iirc, it was an option on the '68 and 69 models."
4786,"July 14, 2006 6:36AM",qbrozen,"is there any hope for this diesel passat?
let's say the bidding tops at $500, for instance. i'm seeing $350 for a windshield, a few more bucks for some trim here and there ... don't know what a new mirror would cost, but considering it should be body-color, that's a bit of a problem. maybe just replace both with black ones? ah... but now we come to the ac and electrical gremlins. yikes. i dunno. its still a diesel, and we know how the market is gobbling these up right now. is there any chance of coming out right on this car?"
4787,"July 14, 2006 7:21AM",Mr_Shiftright,"older passats are pretty bad cars. that's another one of those perennial, incurable lemons you couldn't give to me for free.

i think the enchantment with diesels is fast a-waning, except for heavy work trucks. the cost of diesel fuel, which at least in california easily exceeds premium fuel prices, negates any fuel economy advantage, and as for running on veggie oil, that honeymoon seems to last for about two weeks.

there are old diesels and new diesels and a world between them in efficiency and reliability....i think the old ones are just old clunkers in a 2006 world. small tds getting 50-60 mpg, well, that makes sense."
4788,"July 14, 2006 8:11AM",qbrozen,i guess all the current diesel fanatics are in my neck o' the woods. its the cheapest fuel going here. add that to the increased economy and it can save you alot of money.
4789,"July 14, 2006 8:12AM",andre1969,"in california? here in my area of maryland, it's common to see diesel for $2.85-$3.00 per gallon, while gasoline is around $3.10/$3.20/$3.30+ for 87/89/93."
4790,"July 14, 2006 8:20AM",michaellno,"if i were to go down that path, it would be a jetta wagon or passat wagon (of course, if i had enough money, an mb e-class diesel would be nice, too).

but, at our closest station, diesel is as expensive as premium, which is, i believe, .20 or .30 more than 'regular' unleaded."
4791,"July 14, 2006 8:21AM",lemko,no hidden headlights on any 1970 chevrolets. i love the 1970 full-size chevrolet's front end because it reminds me very much of a buick.
4792,"July 14, 2006 8:21AM",Mr_Shiftright,"you won't save any money though because the old diesels just break down all the time--you'd need a brand new diesel to make it work i think.

yep, diesel popularity is all tied into fuel costs. they make no sense whatsoever where i live (which is why i ditched mine btw).

let's see...diesel fuel is probably 20% higher than 87 octane, which i use now...so if my car gets 37 mpg, i'd need to have a diesel getting...what...about, oh, 44 mpg--45 mpg for me to just break even here. an old passat or old benz diesel isn't going to do that, but a new vw tdi would."

4795,"July 14, 2006 8:52AM",andre1969,"had a brief affair with diesel back in late 1996/early 1997. he bought a used 1994 gmc 3/4 ton, 4wd pickup with a 396 turbodiesel. we lost track of how many times that thing went back into the shop for repairs. it was never the engine or driveline itself, but all the peripheral crap, like computers, sensors, emissions crap, etc.

he finally got fed up with it, and that may traded it on a new '97 silverado v-6."

4797,"July 14, 2006 9:14AM",michaellno,"...did the diesel thing back in the 80's -- at the time, they had a '73 toyota corona, which i totalled one morning on the way to school.

to replace it, my dad found a '72 mb 220d. don't remember how much they paid for it, but i do distinctly remember it going in for an engine rebuild not long after we got it.

we kept it for several years after that. i swear, that was (and probably will be) the slowest vehicle i ever drove. i think it had 65hp and weighed north of 3000 pounds.

mom hated it .. hated to wait for the glow plugs to warm up so the car could be started, hated the stiff throttle spring (my leg got numb driving it up i-5 for vacation one year), hated the smoke, the smell and the noise.

for christmas one year, i got them a personalized plate ...

cool looking 914. for the price, it should be no excuses. how does this compare to the future shiftymobile?

4799,"July 14, 2006 4:15PM",Mr_Shiftright,"geez, a lot of nonsense being posted in the porsche ads these days. 0-60 in 5.9 seconds on a 911sc....er...maybe with a jato strapped on the back....a porsche 914 getting 44 mpg? is this in a vacuum being pushed down the alps?

porsche 912 -- price is just about right, looks like.

the 1981 and 1984 911s -- it's hard to know if these are bargains or bloodbaths. fer instance, if either of these cars has a rear main oil leak, the oil seal is removed and replaced from inside the engine (oh yes). so a $10,000 porsche leaking through this seal is actually a $2,500 car.

if both cars check out top notch, then they are good deals by about $2,000 to $4,000 dollars. but....but...if they need some work, that $2k to $4k advantage is quickly eaten away. both cars sound good but visual inspection and a cylinder leakdown test are mandatory.

case in point. my friend's '88 cabriolet ran strong but had a raggedy idle. we did a cylinder leakdown and had a 40% drop in two cylinders. tore it down and found lots of carbonization in the cylinder heads from the low mileage and non-use over the years. and yet if anyone drove it, they would never have noticed probably."

also a car that you can maybe patch up in the pits.

i think a beater bmw 325 might be perfect as well, since having all the power windows not working and the check engine light on all the time (the bmw night light, i call them) is irrelevant....and you'll need a car with a strong engine (bmw's forte) for the dreaded brick test. american motors aren't keen on high rpm."
4810,"July 15, 2006 8:34AM",british_rover,"yeah i can't think of many american cars that are going to be cheap enough to make it through that kind of punishment.

maybe a older h-body car from the late 80's early 90's might be ok. you can find a lot of those vehicles with lower miles as they were typically driven by older people. the 3800 engine in them is strong although its top end is not stellar. i would probably want to replace the timing chain in one for some added insurance as the chains do stretch towards the end of their life and throw off the ignition timing."

i always thought the 2nd gen 929 was a very sexy car, but it has one of the world's worst driving positions, at least imo. the tranny hump takes out a large portion of the foot area, forcing your legs together, but the steering wheel does not tilt, and it's too low for my tastes, so i'd have to sit in the car with my knees spread out, but my feet crammed together, in kind of a bowlegged position.

i remember at the time, the salesman telling me the reason that the 929 didn't have a tilt wheel was because it had an airbag. and i believed him. and totally forgot about the conversation with time. until a few years later, when i bought an '89 gran fury, with an airbag and a tilt wheel! :blush:"

my mom had an '86 toyota cressida, briefly (put 50k on it in a year and a half--she was a 3com salesperson; she put 50k on the '84 camry she traded for the cressida as well), sold it to a co-worker, who just put it out of commission w/about 300k...it had a similar button-tufted interior, but in blue/gray velour, which is at least a bit less pimpy. i remember riding in that car going 115 in the rain on i-294 with my brother driving (17 year-old boys are stupid, in case we don't remember). they were nice cars, but not too roomy, not good in snow or rain, hogged gas for their size--typical rwd, fairly powerful car nitpicks. still, comparable, at least on paper, to a 5-series bmw of the era, in many ways, for half the price, and super durable/reliable, if a bit silly with the '80s japanese gizmo-laden interiors."

so give me your opinion on the following trade:

2000 lexus rx300, gold with tan leather, 124k miles. interior is clean, but overall in slightly below average condition due to various scratches on the plastics and the leather. it still has a lingering smell in it. needs about $1000 in body work (and it will have some light scratches and dings afterwards). just put in new floormats and new rx400h wheels and tires. mechanically good with all service done, new brakes, etc. one owner before me (a friend of my wife). i have $8,920 in it, if that matters.

other car is a 2000 honda ex v6 sedan with 124k miles on it. tan leather interior isn't perfect, but nicer than mine. mechanically great with receipts since day one. the dark green exterior has a couple boo-boos a paintless dent guy could get and a good knock to the rocker panel/lower door. you could probably make the exterior great for less than a $1000. it got a brand new transmission at 40k, and been great since. two owners, both friends of mine. most importantly, it does not smell bad.

this guy is a great friend, so nobody should get an upper hand on this deal. so what is the cash difference between these two paragons of excitement?

the point of all of this is to give me more cash (and leverage with the wife) to buy an additional fun car for me."
4834,"July 17, 2006 11:01AM",Mr_Shiftright,"probably $4,000--$5,000 difference, advantage lexus. the lexus has outstanding resale value whereas the honda will depreciate rapidly, therefore making it difficult to recoup any rehabilitation costs.

in other words, you put $3,000 into the lexus you'll get $3,000 more. if you put $3,000 into the honda, it's pretty much lost.

given this reality, the lexus is worth more today, tomorrow and forever imo."

4865,"July 18, 2006 1:08PM",michaellno,"my folks had an '84 liftback with an automatic; not the gt-s with the wheel flares, but just a regular gt. wasn't terribly quick, but at least the tranny had an od switch, so it cruised at 65 without boring a hole in your eardrums.

mom had the timing belt (chain?) break on her about 35 miles from home, and since it was an interference engine, it took some $$$ to make it right.

they got tired of only having 2 doors so they sold it and bought a used camry to replace it.

speaking of celicas, when i was a kid my dad had a friend who owned a '79 liftback. yellow with black interior and custom wheels. i really, really, really wanted that car.

here's a similar local car

about those celicas...i saw an old old lady driving a maybe 80-81 (quad lights) liftback over the weekend. she was going slow (maybe 3mph in a parking lot), the car was brown, and in excellent condition."
4868,"July 18, 2006 2:12PM",Mr_Shiftright,"you're not allowed to call it ""frisco"". that's a terrible social gaff down here. :p

nissan patrol vs. fj40 -- much the same as i recall, very much the same, but the patrol is much rarer and much cheaper (what's not to like).

i just said i wanted it. that doesn't mean i want to write a check for it. i want the seller to give it to me after reading about my love and devotion to this vehicle."

contour- buy a good one, if the cel is on, there is a reason. my guess is the gaskets in the manifolds, vacuum leak, or 02 sensors. it thinks its lean when it is really rich so it dumps too much fuel in and then the downstream o2 sensor can't figure out why its not burning it all. people don't take care of cars and wonder why they don't work.
celica- 22 series toyota motors are fantastic if you are not in a hurry. all you folks whining :p about diesels being too slow better not have a lot of love for that thing.
general trend of all the british cars-i think a lot of today's cars are so boring, people are looking for something for romantic from the brits or the italians. an alfa gtv has more sole than the celica will ever have."
4871,"July 18, 2006 7:53PM",british_rover,"i have been thinking about getting into four-wheeling as there are a couple of good clubs in the area here. one of them goes out every other weekend for the whole year and i figure i would get a lot more chances to use a nicely built 4x4 then i will a little sports car or autocrosser.

i also think it would be good for business as i could probably rope a few of my customers to joining the club as well.

so i have been on the look out for a cheap xj, zj or mj. a rover would be nice but only the older ones are cheap enough and most of them are very questionable in terms of quality.

i spot this xj for sale on the side of the road and pull over to look at it. the kid that owns it is outside and we start to talking. brief run down of the jeep. it is a 1994 sport model four door.

first the good.

white with gray interior that is not too bad on first inspection.

custom tube style front and rear bumpers that greatly improve approach/departure angles along with built in tow hooks. 31x10.50 bfg mud terrain tires on wider aftermarket rims and a 3 inch skyjacker lift kit. rock sliders that seem to be firmly attached to the unibody. manual tranny which could be intersting as i have never wheeled with a manual tranny vehicle. it should make the jeep's crawl ratio a lot better at least.

now the bad.

184,000 miles on it which is not that bad as i have seen plenty of these vehicles make it to 250,000 miles.

rear doors do not open from the outside. rusty rocker pannels that the rock sliders do a fair job of hiding. i have noticed that living in the northeast for the past year that lots of xjs get this rusty rocker pannel syndrome.

not sure how easy it is to fix so i will have to check that out.

other then that it seems ok but the kid wants 2,000 dollars for it. :sick:

his potential pool of buyers is very small since he is selling a rusty, modded manual tranny vehicle so i will see how much i can beat him down."
4872,"July 18, 2006 8:42PM",steine13,"it's the height of summer, and you work in the biz... 2000/01 jeep cherokee 4x4's are going for $5 to $6 if they've got 90k or so... and if they're in good shape.

rust never sleeps... i watched a friend go through this agony with a cj jeep (or whatever the wrangler predecessor was called -- i'm not up on these). he bought the darned thing for $5 or so, and when the repair total hit $10, we stopped counting. and it wasn't over by a long shot.

that was a vehicle with about a dozen moving parts... it's amazing what breaks when they get old enough.

4873,"July 19, 2006 5:27AM",andre1969,"i have a model of a '69 dart as well as that '68 gss, but my '69 is just a gts. i've heard of the western sport special, but don't know much about it.

here's an old ad for one. it wasn't a performance package, but just a dress up package. and if they're talking about carpeting being one of the options, i wonder if it was a dress-up package for the entry level dart? the upper level dart, the custom, had carpeting standard iirc. and the custom had a nicer looking piece of side trim, while the base dart had nothing, so that trim piece along the side was probably part of the wss package too?

here's a pic that shows the decal up close

i've heard of the white hat special, too. i think the white hat special was more of a nationwide sales campaign, where the western sport special was, well, more ""western""?"
4874,"July 19, 2006 6:00AM",andre1969,"but i kinda like that '66 imperial you posted, fintail. a buddy of mine had a '65 imperial sedan, but it's been years since i've seen it or him. it was silver with a light blue interior, and i remember the power seat was stuck in a position that was just perfect for him, at about 5'8"". which means that i couldn't fit my 6'3"" frame comfortably behind the wheel.

i guess the style does show what a lincoln stylist could do to a '57 imperial. that's basically what the car is underneath, althought the only real giveaway is the wraparound windshield. supposedly the 2- and 4-door hardtops used the same roofline on these cars, but i dunno if that's true or not.

i like the '66 jetstar too. what engine would that be...a 330? it looks to me like the smaller block that was ultimately used for stuff ranging from the 260 on up to the 403, and not the bigger 425/455 block. i don't really care for the exterior color so much, but i always loved that shade of bluish green that seemed so common on oldsmobile interiors back then. usually the exterior color was a lighter shade of blue/green though."
4875,"July 19, 2006 7:08AM",qbrozen,"i've been out of the jeep loop for a while, but i'm still going to stand up for the '70s jeeps over anything in the chrysler era. if you can find one where the body isn't rusting off, you are way ahead of the game. everything mechanical on those amc jeeps was bulletproof. low-stressed iron-block simple engines, dana differentials, good old manual locking hubs, etc.

however, that's from a 4x4 project standpoint. if you are looking to just buy and drive, i could see arguing in the other direction. the '70s jeeps aren't exactly the epitome of comfort and convenience."

here is the rest of the story about this kid.

he has three trucks he is selling a 80s area dodge ramcharger. that is like dodge's version of a bronco.

another 80s era k20 chevy pickup.

he has a new truck on order and is trying to sell all of these before the new one gets here. the trucks that don't sell will be traded in for the new truck. real money trade side for a modded, rusty, manual tranny jeep is less than 500 bucks. if no one buys the jeep before his new truck comes in i might be able to snap up the jeep for 750 bucks and i would be ok with that."

by that time though, buick put 1984 electra seats in the '85 lesabre limited, so it might have been a bit more plush than an '82 delta. i wonder if olds put 98 seats in the top line delta 88, though?

it's kinda funny though, seeing a car that plush with crank windows! kind of an interesting color, too. if i needed a car and it were closer, i'd be tempted to have a look at it."

dave's classic cars

i guess that most of these cars are buildable and it's cool that they're being saved, but it's weird to see them all together.

there doesn't seem to be much ryhme or reason to the pricing. a destroyed 67 malibu with no drivetrain is worth $2500??? to be fair, that is the most impressive collection of beat up 78-81 trans ams and camaros that i've ever seen anywhere"
4896,"July 20, 2006 7:18AM",andre1969,"i'm not sure, but i think by 1977 power windows would have been standard in something like an electra, 98, riviera, toronado, and any lincoln or caddy on the market.

i know that in 1979 power windows were standard on the new yorker and nyer 5th avenue. although oddly, air conditioning was still an option. in contrast, i think by '79 a/c was standard on something like an electra/98/riv/toro class of car, as well as the caddies and lincolns.

power windows were still optional on the rwd lesabre/delta 88 on up through the end in 1985. even on the top line brougham/limited ""collector's edition"" models. and i'm pretty sure i've seen some of the newer, fwd lesabres and 88's with crank windows.

i'd guess by around 1991 or so, power windows were pretty much standard on full-sized cars, even the cheaper ones. and by the mid-late 90's, were standard on most midsized cars? and now it seems that most compact and even subcompact cars seem to be getting them standard. i guess in the long run, it's cheaper for the manufacturer to just make them all power for the sake of consistency, rather than some power and some crank.

my uncle's '03 corolla has crank windows. and my buddy's '98 tracker had them. but they're becoming much more rare. heck, even with most of the older cars i've been getting, they've all had power windows lately. i think the most recently i've picked up a crank-window car was in 1999, when someone gave me a beat-up '67 newport."
4897,"July 20, 2006 7:21AM",british_rover,"re crank windows i think even the next gen wranglers will finally have power windows as an option.

interesting that they'd ask $5250 for it. i think that's what the car weighed...5250 pounds. so a buck a pound!

history

i purchased this car in 1983 and began a complete restoration that lasted seven years. during this time the car was stripped, media blasted, and a few small rust spots on the floor panels and boot floor were repaired. the sound sills and doglegs were then treated with finnegan&#146;s waxoyl for protection against future corrosion. the car was painted in 1985, has been waxed regularly, and has always been garaged.

during the first five or six years after its restoration, the car was shown in concours events and won several awards at both regional and national levels. most of the flaws in the paint from the 15 years the car has been on the road are only noticeable if you get down on your hands and knees. the car would still show well at a people&#146;s choice concours.

if you&#146;re interested in autocross, i have a kirkey seat, five point harness, and kumho&#146;s mounted on authentic british minilite wheels (14x6 powder-coated black) available for separate purchase.

this car was selected by grassroots motorsports magazine as the best overall vintage roadster among the six cars (mgb, triumph tr6, lotus elan, datsun 2000, mazda miata, alfa romeo, and lancia zagato) tested in its march/april 1998 issue. in that article publisher suddard stated, &#147;the car&#146;s handling was impeccable on the autocross course, yet it was completely docile and comfortable around the paddock. we&#146;ve never been big mgb fans, but we came away very impressed with this well-modified, well-restored, well-sorted little car.&#148;

fluid changes and maintenance have been attended to religiously throughout my ownership. the absence of time to care for it, and a lotus that needs a paint job, dictate its sale. it&#146;s now ready for someone else to cherish and enjoy.

the pictures on this one look good. he said we will need a truck for all of the extra parts he will give us.

any last minute advice?"
4923,"July 21, 2006 6:40AM",qbrozen,"i'm voting on the '72. its just a nice looking vehicle with some very tasteful add-ons and modifications.

that '68 was painted 21 years ago (by the way, why paint a car in year 2 of a 7-year resto? it doesn't make sense. so he continued doing heavy work on the vehicle after paying for paint?)"
4924,"July 21, 2006 6:44AM",british_rover,i agree go for the 72.
4925,"July 21, 2006 7:33AM",lemmer,"we also prefer the '72, but are trying to keep open minds until we see them up close and drive them."
4926,"July 21, 2006 9:16AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i think when you drive the '68 it's going to knock your teeth out when you hit a bump, judging from the specs.

too radical and unnecessary. the best mgb is the one you don't mess around with (with a few rare exceptions)."

4928,"July 21, 2006 10:14AM",lemmer,"kinda makes you wonder what kind of things it needs...

i bet they aren't easy and inexpensive things."
4929,"July 21, 2006 10:34AM",Mr_Shiftright,"alfa might be okay if the ""needs"" aren't horrendous. problem with these cars is finding someone who knows how to work on them. if you can nail that down, you can take a chance and have some cheap fun. but if you don't have a good wrench to work with, just forget it. you will be treated like the plague at most shops."

4931,"July 21, 2006 12:25PM",stickguy,"i would lean toward the blue one also, although i do like green!

if nothing else, it is a good bargaining chip. if ebay died out in the mid 6's, offer him $7,500 (or whatever number sounds right to you) cash, and if he balks, mention the other one you are going to drive over to see."
4932,"July 21, 2006 12:36PM",british_rover,"cooper s there would need to be bought at about 2,000 to 2,500 less then what they are asknig to be worth while i think. i mean they hold their value but not that well. that one does not have the lsd option which was avaliable in 2005."
4933,"July 21, 2006 2:48PM",andre1969,"is what the marauder was before they called it ""marauder"". my old car book only lists it as a separate model for 1966, when 669 convertibles and 2,916 fastback hardtop coupes were built. it came with a 345 hp 428, which was optional on other full-sized models.

the book mentions that the s-55 first came out in 1962 though. it's a fine line i guess, between an option package and a separate model.

as for that '81 monte carlo, this is a scary thought, but here in maryland it would qualify for antique plates. :p i forgot that those older models had that dreadful woodgrain on the dash. my '86 just had black plastic trim that was kind of shiny, and gave it a bit of a futuristic look."

4935,"July 21, 2006 6:12PM",qbrozen,"actually, that somebody would be me. depending on how good the new paint is and what the condition of the rest of the car is, i think having such an oddity as the shelby charger is worth $2k.
mostly just because its a turbo and cranking up the power is simple and cheap (until the engine blows)."
4936,"July 21, 2006 6:30PM",british_rover,yup then rinse and repeat.

4938,"July 22, 2006 6:11AM",british_rover,"you think that interior is busy have you ever seen a cooper s with the lapis blue leather interior?

it looks nice at first but i think it would wear on you after a while."
4939,"July 22, 2006 9:30AM",Mr_Shiftright,i'm already suffering vertigo from the photos of the cooper s you posted. first thing i'd do is paint everything flat black that i could get my hands on and maybe by a wood trim stick-on kit or something to break up that plumbing environment. i would feel like i'm driving a luxury bathroom.
4940,"July 22, 2006 11:12AM",fintail,not many of these left
4941,"July 22, 2006 2:17PM",fintail,i think these have some kind of oddball following
4942,"July 22, 2006 3:27PM",ghulet,"i like that olds 98 quite a bit. strangely, there's one almost exactly like it (sans vinyl top, but same color and body style) near me. the guy parks it on the street, which must be quite a challenge on the north side of chicago.

those typhoons seem to be priced at about double what i'd ever dream of paying for one. let's remember, after all, these are 15 year-old gm trucks, bottom line. i imagine it's not terribly easy to find model-specific parts for these, either.

here are a couple from the 'my financial problems justify my asking top dollar' file:

good move putting all this stuff into... a 98 malibu?

nice enough car but where did the 45,000 invested go?

some cars have a better following but i think that this looks good for the money"
4944,"July 22, 2006 4:22PM",british_rover,that 442 looks like a good buy for the money.
4945,"July 22, 2006 4:30PM",Mr_Shiftright,"wrong engine...if it's a 425 it's probably a lower hp out of a delta 88 or some such. so wrong engine plus losing 50-60 hp, that's not so good for resale value. asking price migh be very close to correct price. with original engine, closer to $15,000.

re: '96 buick regal----hey, if his grandparents ""never drove it"", it should have no miles on it, right? :p"
4946,"July 22, 2006 4:47PM",british_rover,"hmhh i just noticed something that 442 is an automatic. didn't 442 stand for four barrel, four speed and dual exhaust or something like that?"
4947,"July 22, 2006 5:09PM",ghulet,"i think that was the drill, though i imagine at least half the '4-4-2s' were sold with automatics.

i'm wondering if that actually is a 'real' 4-4-2. i don't see any model insignias, and it's a two-door sedan, the variety that should cost the least. also, the paint looks pretty amateur, then we have the aforementioned incorrect engine, aftermarket wheels and steering wheel, which i don't usually like on a 'collector' car. i think $8500 is probably about right."
4948,"July 22, 2006 7:03PM",steine13,"well, i talked to the guy on the phone, convinced myself he was who he said he was, and sent him a $300 money order. he sent me the keys, and everything was done a week after he placed the ad.
the truck is as advertised; the clutch master cylinder was indeed bad, but it started right up after sitting over two months.
yesterday, i spent a very tense 3 miles driving it home across town... only had to stop once... left turn onto a busy street... to restart, i cranked the starter in first gear and bunny-hopped out into the intersection... thankfully, no cops in sight. it was pretty nerve-wracking.

made it home with no problems; even hit 3rd gear along the way. it was like the movie ""speed"": keep it above 55! or, in my case, 3 mph.

anyway, the lord is kind and merciful and the master cyl was in stock at my favorite autozone. installed it this morning, bled the system with my 7-year-old pumping the pedal, and wah-lah: by noon, i had me a running truck for $320 before title and tax.

the exhaust manifold is leaking and the thing is pretty loud... a few wheel studs have broken off... and the wife is lightly foaming at the mouth...(""my daughter is not riding in this piece of crap..."").
other than that, no complaints :-)

-mathias"
4949,"July 22, 2006 7:13PM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh c'mon wifey, that was a great buy on your part! all you have to do now is know when to stop fixing it. the exhaust manifold might just be a gasket, and if it's cracked they can be welded by someone who knows how to do cast iron.

wheel studs are pretty easy fix, or just get a hub from the wreckers."
4950,"July 23, 2006 8:51AM",andre1969,"""4-4-2"" stood for ""4bbl carb, 4-speed tranny, and dual exhaust"". in later years though i think it meant 400 cubic inches, 4-bbl, dual exhaust. and i'm sure in other years they had to change it to other things. i wonder how they tried to justify it with those funky little late 70's aeroback jobs with the chevy 305. they probably still had a 4-bbl carb and dual exhaust. maybe they even still offered a 4-speed floor shift? iirc, pontiac offered that tranny in a handful of grand prixes around that time."

wifey has put her foot down, though - as much attention as the alfa has needed lately no beaters for my everyday car. never mind that the dodge hauled me around for 2 yrs and 20k miles like a champ. it was pretty loud when i bought it, too - it was missing 2 or 3 exhaust nuts. a couple of bucks at ace hardware and i was golden.

another big eldo

early xj....quite pretty, quite pricey"
4953,"July 23, 2006 10:19AM",andre1969,"i wonder how that '68 malibu does with the 700r4 overdrive tranny? those things really weren't all that strong initially, which is why back in the early 80's the cadillacs with the v-8-6-4 got the thm350 (thm400 in the limos), while i think the diesels, 4.1 v-6, and 4.1 v-8 got the 700r4.

still, in later years that tranny was strong enough to go up behind the 305 in the monte carlo ss and the buick grand national, so it could be beefed up.

i always liked the idea of taking an older car and putting a 4-speed automative overdrive tranny in it, for a bit better highway economy. only problem is, with chryslers i hear you have to cut out the driveshaft hump and basically build your own new one, because the tranny is bigger. chrysler never built a 4-speed automatic for their rwd cars, but did for trucks, and i guess it's shaped differently. also, i hear it's not as reliable as the old torqueflites so any fuel savings might be killed by more frequent/expensive rebuilds."
4954,"July 23, 2006 1:49PM",british_rover,that eldo was fwd???
4955,"July 23, 2006 3:09PM",andre1969,"yep, the eldorado was fwd starting in 1967, when it went to the same body style as the toronado. the riviera was also on the same platform, but was rwd.

the fwd setup wasn't the fragile type that we normally think of when it comes to fwd cars. basically they took the thm400 transmission, turned it around backwards, put it beside the engine, kind of tucked in under one bank of cylinders, and it had a chain drive that connected the engine to the tranny. it was supposedly very durable, but i think one weak spot was that it had low ground clearance, at least by 60's standards. the engine sat fore-aft, just like in a rwd car.

i remember reading that the '71-78 eldorado held the record for the world's largest car with fwd. and if you watch the first ""terminator"" movie, there's a car chase scene involving a '76 or so eldorado coupe. in one scene it burns rubber with its front wheel in a parking garage. i thought that was freaky the first time i saw it, because in the movies you usually saw a car spinning out with the rear wheels. and back in the early 80's i doubt if i really knew what ""fwd"" was...except that i remember my granddad said it sucked when it broke! :p"

4958,"July 24, 2006 6:26AM",lemmer,"that thing is sweet!

if it makes you feel any better, my wife would have said the same thing.

i had a friend recently get a free old mazda b2000. when my friend wouldn't pay $900 for it, the guy ended up giving it to him do he wouldn't have to pay someone to haul it away. my friend spent around $200 on tune up parts and an ebay bumper to take it from a non-runner to a daily driver."
4959,"July 24, 2006 6:46AM",lemmer,"i know you guys are tired of this '72 mgb, and now, so am i. we drove ten hours round trip to see it (and buy it we thought). the paint was bad. the majority of the car was covered in small blisters. the guy said it happened because he wrapped the car in plastic for a hurricane and left it out in the sun for two months after. that doesn't account for the mediocre prep work, and the places where the original light yellow paint was showing through the chips and peeling on the panel edges and such. the door and trunk fit were atrocious. the overdrive didn't work. it had a radio shack tape player but no speakers. he had 'fast and furious' boost and air/fuel ratio gauges mounted in front of the shift boot. the wood trim needed refinishing. the leather and vinyl had wear, mediocre installation, and a couple of holes. it had rust in the battery boxes. it had rust in the engine compartment where the front fenders and the hood meet. it looked like it had broken welds in the same general area. the wire wheels were starting to rust. all the tires were cheapos and were dry rotting. one was completely bald, and the others had odd wear patterns.

when i look at the ebay pictures, i still can't believe it was the same car, but clearly it is."
4960,"July 24, 2006 6:48AM",qbrozen,yikes! sorry to hear it. what happened with the other one?
4961,"July 24, 2006 6:52AM",lemmer,"oh, and the guy said his bottom line price was $14,000. i think he should go back and find that high bidder at $6,600 and see if the guy will still pay that.

i am going to work for a little while and then post about mgb #2."
4962,"July 24, 2006 8:35AM",lemmer,"this is a green '68.

it is in nearly perfect mechanical condition. if there is anything that didn't work or was worn, i couldn't find it. it felt far peppier than other mgbs i have driven. the handling was great, but the ride did not seem too stiff. to get it ready for sale, he replaced the steering rack, brake master cylinder and all brake components, and put new tires on it. i honestly believe if this guy knew of anything else to fix, he would have done so before he put it up for sale.

the interior was really nice. it has connolly leather seats that were showing a little wear with a small tear in the driver seat. the top had some wear to it, but a replacement wouldn't be required for a good while. no real complaints about anything here.

the paint is the only issue. the paint is twenty years old, and i suspect the prep work could have been a little better. supposedly painted with top notch dupont paint. road rash has worn off all of the paint on the fender lips behind both rear tires. the paint has stars coming out around several of the convertible top attachment points. it is starting to spiderweb some behind the top. it has some swirl-like scratches in several areas that are noticeable. it looks like they might have been there before the paint job and just reasserted themselves over the years. around the wiper arms, the paint is faded a little bit. all in all, the paint job looks perfect from ten feet, but has numerous flaws up close. the passenger door fit is perfect, the driver door has a tiny bit of sag. the chrome is all good, but not great with one noticeable area pressed in on the front bumper guard. under the front bumper the sheetmetal is dinged pretty good from a possum incident.

dude wants $13,900, decided he would take $12,000. it comes with a pile of spares and extras. if the paint was a little better, we might have driven home in it, but my friend wanted to sleep on it. we suspect it might be worth closer to $10,000 but my friend is willing to pay a little more just to get it done. he is buying it as a gift, and just can't make up his mind whether the paint is nice enough to make it a no apologies gift car. we fear that the spiderwebbing areas might get bad pretty fast if the car is used in the sun regularly (this happened to my old mgb in a big way).

i really like this car. for the right price, i would have bought it for myself."
4963,"July 24, 2006 8:45AM",Mr_Shiftright,"a series i 1973 jaguar jx would be my candidate for inclusion in the ten worst cars in the world list. $2,500 would be generous to a fault, because you'll never stop fixing it and you'll never get the car right.

mgb--i don't think the car is worth $12,000 either. rememeber they made 1/2 million of these cars and most of them came here."
4964,"July 24, 2006 10:43AM",ghulet,"i think for $12k if i just wanted a fun little ragtop, i'd be finding myself a miata. i like collector cars and all, but i feel like if they don't cost substantially less or offer a substantially different experience than something newer, then why bother? maybe i'm way off base here, but i just can't see spending that kind of dough on an old mgb."
4965,"July 24, 2006 10:52AM",lemmer,"i get that feeling too. my $12k (or even $10k) would go for a miata. i also think about how nice of a porsche 944 turbo i could get for $12k.

but in this case, the car is for someone who has owned and raced mgbs in his younger days. he doesn't have any interest in a miata at any price. people want what they want, and that is ok."
4966,"July 24, 2006 11:00AM",lemmer,speaking of 944 turbos. this one seems pretty decent for $8k. his propensity for jacking up the boost worries me a little.

mgb -- that car is overpriced at $12k because mgb lovers won't like it and in a few years it'll look like hell and you'll have to sell at 1/2 the price, if that."
4969,"July 24, 2006 1:10PM",lemmer,"it seems like all of the mgs we look at are owned by engineering types, and they do all the work on the cars themselves. this seems to work ok until they get to the paint. subpar paint & prepwork has been the common denominator on all the cars i have seen so far. they all look like they have been done in someones hobby garage."
4970,"July 24, 2006 1:37PM",andre1969,"an engineer really doesn't care how it looks, just as long as it functions correctly? i know we have a couple aerospace engineers here at work that can barely dress themselves! but they're pretty good at keeping things in orbit and stuff like that, so i guess they serve their purpose. :p"
4971,"July 24, 2006 2:49PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well mgbs are very simple. you hardly have to be an engineer, so the car encourages hobbyists in that sense.

some upgrades are really good ideas on an mgb but one has to be sober about it. this is a car with 1932 technology, and there's only so much one can do to it.

the most irritating ""upgrades"" are imo putting a weber carburator on it (complete waste of money) or tossing the attractive alloy wheels and putting on troublesome wire wheels at great expense and to little purpose. also the exhaust note is perfect and the installation of fart cans on the mgb really bugs me.

to the good might be electronic ignition, an auxiliary cooling fan and modified shock absorbers to replace the lever type. also carbon fiber leaf springs is not a bad idea if the old ones are saggin'.

overdrive is a big plus and i'd pay $1,000 extra for it at least."
4972,"July 24, 2006 3:29PM",jaserb,"i sold my '87 quad for $4200 or so. it had high miles but was ready to roll- its worst problem was a tear in the front spoiler. it went to new jersey, coincidentally enough.

i can't really fathom $12k for an mgb with so-so paint, either. that seems more like tr6 money to me.

4979,"July 25, 2006 6:41AM",andre1969,"i actually kinda like that '87 safari. every once in awhile i've toyed with the idea of getting a gm wagon like that to replace my pickup when it finally kicks the bucket. i was thinking it might get better mileage, for one thing. however, i've got the truck up to about 14 mpg now. and i'm pretty confident that i could get one of those gm wagons down to about 14 mpg! after all, they weigh about the same (~4000 pounds) and use similar engines (307 versus 305) and i doubt the overdrive tranny in the wagon would make much difference in my type of driving.

plus, while a wagon could do a lot of the stuff that my truck does, there's still alot that the truck does that it couldn't do. so when the time comes, i'll probably just replace it with another truck.

one of my roommates has a 1995 f-150 back in michigan that he's been thinking about bringing out here. it has the 351, 4-speed automatic, a towing package, and about 110,000 miles. i wonder how it would compare to my old 305 silverado?"

re: the automatic m3....i see a lot of those in my area. never quite understood it, it's not like a manual wasn't available (as with amg cars)...but a lot of them sell to people who will never take it above 75, so that might explain it.

i'd say those '67-68 imperials are probably my least favorite imperial (well, okay, once you go back before 1955 there were some pretty stodgy chrysler imperials to go counteract the timeless ones), but even i like that one. especially if it looks good in person. i kinda like that color on it, too."

5011,"July 26, 2006 5:17PM",Mr_Shiftright,"well it doesn't look too bad really...as long as the floorboards are reasonably intact and the chassis underneath isn't dangerously rusted. it has the typical '57 rust areas. bodywork is mostly about patience. if you're going to keep it as a driver you don't have to do show quality work. the 4-doors won't ever have the value of the 2-dr hardtops or converts so you have to set a budget in line with the car's potential value....something like $15,000 should be about as far as you want to go.

you can get a lot done for that amount of $$$ if you do some of it yourself and/or farm out the tricky stuff to people who might give you a discount.

i think you can bring this car back under budget."
5012,"July 26, 2006 6:08PM",ghulet,"...at least it's a four-door hardtop, which i think are fairly rare; i think it's more a drag that it's a six-cylinder, but of course, that's more easily changed than the body style. i like the original color, and it looks complete and restorable. just make sure, like shiftright said, not to 'over-restore' it. it could be a fun driver, don't make it into a trailer queen or something you'd otherwise be reluctant to drive, or you couldn't sell and stay solvent.

fintail, i love that 300sel--that's my favorite body (lwb) in one of my favorite color combos (smoke silver with creme beige leather) with the best (if not fastest) engine. nice."
5013,"July 26, 2006 6:55PM",fintail,"yeah that 126 looked nice. i think i will always like those cars, excellent design and quality, really one of the best sedans ever made.

a bit big

debatable use of ""classic"""
5014,"July 26, 2006 8:51PM",Mr_Shiftright,"actually it would be a good car to modify with a crate motor and 4 speed transmission. you could probably sell the 6 cylinder engine or swap it for labor. some vintage ac, a good sound system, some make-do bodywork and a modest paint job, and you have a good looking car that can actually go somewhere on a modern road."
5015,"July 27, 2006 5:07AM",andre1969,"i think that's cool, too, seeing a '57 chevy 4-door hardtop. i know they're usually not worth a whole lot, but i always liked the 4-door hardtop body style. and with '57 chevies it seems like the 2-door sedans, 2-door hardtops, and convertibles have been done to death, to the point i hardly notice them anymore."
5016,"July 27, 2006 5:46AM",lemko,"i like that '57 chevy four door hardtop as it is indicative of the kind of cars most people drove back then. if you go to your typical car show, the uninitiated would think everybody drove two-door hardtops or convertibles back in the day."

in contrast it seems like plymouth, desoto, pontiac, and chrysler wanted to limit their high-power engines to their top-line supercars (fury, adventurer, bonneville, 300 letter series)"

that 940 is nice but i would rather have a 89-91 740 turbo so i can get a stick. this might be a lil too old and gone though:

i am thinking of moving my personal search from an na 944 to a turbo, not because i want the extra performance, but because it seems easier to find decent examples (although asking prices seem to run nearly double).

here is a nice '88 turbo that is only a few miles from me."
5047,"July 28, 2006 8:50AM",Mr_Shiftright,"'74 mgb--what's with the rubber front bumper blocks?

85 volvo diesel: this engine comes with a horrible reputation, and with so much grumbling out there about it, one has to presume the worst. sure, it's rare, because it is a thoroughly nasty thing to drive and nobody wanted one.

biodiesel craze -- i wonder if all the people who dream of turning used cooking oil into fuel (not the only way to do biodiesel but the most hyped one) are yet aware of the incredibly toxic chemicals they have to use to make the oil suitable for fuel? ""sure my kids were born with two heads, but i'm saving $2 a gallon on gas!""

1967 olds convertible --- yes, oh ranting seller, you will find these cars for sale for $10,000, but those have tops that go up and down and paint that is not falling off....ah, the old ""it's just a broken line""....why, when something is so ""simple to fix"", doesn't the seller do it prior to sale? the world wants to know....

porsche 944 turbo --- fun to drive. seller being in porsche club is a good sign. better investment since n/a 944s won't ever be worth anything."
5048,"July 28, 2006 9:11AM",lemmer,"i thought the same thing about the bumper guards on the mgb. they look big enough to use the car to push start his airplane.

is that 944 turbo in the ballpark at $11,000?

i recently saw a red one listed as 'absolutely perfect' for $11,000. one of my first email questions was about the motor mounts. the seller admitted that they were shot and needed immediate replacement. why call your car perfect and price it as perfect if you have no chance as passing it off as such when someone comes to look at it?"

5058,"July 28, 2006 6:02PM",andre1969,"did the allante go directly from the 4.1 v-8 to the northstar in its final year, or did it upgrade through the 4.5 and 4.9 iterations of that engine like the other caddies did? it might just be a case of the northstar version being desireable simply by virtue of the other versions being so un-desireable?"
5059,"July 28, 2006 7:08PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i think you're quite right about that...the northstar appeared i think just one year 1993 in the allante and it was desirable because the other engines were so lame. remember this car was touted to compete with the 560sl, which was in fact a pretty darn quick car in its day and would humiliate the early allante in just about every way possible. at least the northstar made the race better than a cruel hoax.

all that kind of reminds me how people often put wide whites on cars too new for such an accessory. i'll see like a 1970 galaxie with wide whites...what's that about? iirc the fintail was one of the last cars using them, offering them through the 1964 model year. my dad's old 68 fairlane had like 2"" whitewalls the previous old codger owner installed...the car was white so it almost worked, but it bugged me just a little.

5064,"July 30, 2006 10:46AM",andre1969,"on the rearview mirror of cars is also something that people did in the 90's with just about any old car, so i guess you could look at it that way. :p i have to confess that i have a pair of fuzzy dice hanging from the rearview mirror of my '67 catalina. plus a garter belt. a coworker gave them to me, so i felt obligated to hang them up for her. um, that's the dice i'm talking about, not the garter belt! :surprise:"

5074,"July 31, 2006 11:06AM",lilengineerboy,"who writes these ads? you think they would read a few others and get a good idea what should be there. year, make, model, trim level, mileage, engine type/size, transmission type/speeds, and options. yeah its great you don't want to haggle on your 35 year old 12 mpg car, but could you please tell us what it is?
at least the grammatical structure of the ads seems to be improving. it kills me when i read the adds for bicycles and they only say how many gears it has and a price (as opposed to size, make, age, etc). pretty much means it came from k-mart to me. if your selling something at least figure out how to describe it, or if you really don't care that much about it, then don't whine about your price."

or it could have a 350-4bbl, or one of two 455's. i think one was a 2-bbl, because 315 gross hp out of a 455 sounds pretty tame. but yeah, at least say what engine it has!"
5076,"July 31, 2006 11:58AM",Mr_Shiftright,"that model a 4door is a good buy if it's as nice as it looks. the 4-doors have more room for the driver, whereas the two doors and roadsters are hell to drive if you're over 5' 9"". also, if this car has only 3 owners, chances are it's not the typical model a ford that has parts from 12 different cars on it + aftermarket items galore.

someone should snatch that car, it's worth it.

t-bird
wth is a monaco edition? well it's just a regular t-bird landau coupe with a certain color scheme and a few extra trim pieces, alleged a replica of the car given to grace kelly by lee iacocca, as if she didn't get enough presents already for gawd's sake. 2,000 were made. the claim of 20-30% extra value sounds like nonsense to me. i mean, who cares? it takes about 20 minutes to explain the car, which is kind of a pathetic form of fame if you ask me.

i saw that one failed to meet reserve in ebay by 50%---top bid was $9,000 and change and that sounds more than fair to me. (seller was asking $19k, another seller was asking $31k!!!). needless to say, they still own them....

if special editions have serious hardware that you can't buy on a regular model, well that often counts for something...you know, like a boss 302 or an rs/ss camaro. but a couple of twinkie upholstery bits----nah, i don't think so."
5077,"July 31, 2006 12:34PM",fintail,"i agree with all that. i have even less faith in humanity after discovering craigslist. so many ads don't state mileage, mechanical details, don't have pics, etc. and i've seen many that don't state the year! especially on modern cars that look newer than they are - aka the owner is ashamed to admit the car is 10 years old. all of this usually means the seller is hiding something. the worst ads don't state the price. it's not ebay, people.

bad grammar and spelling are still very common...even spelling the name of the car incorrectly. it's not a typo when it is repeated through the ad."

the late '60s 912 does have a pure porsche engine that puts out 90 hp, i think. it is very similar to the 356 engine. you still need a porsche mechanic and porsche parts. you might be better off with a pumped-up bug engine in the back, but don't tell shifty i said that."

the 912 engine is a porsche 356 engine. it's okay at 90hp, the car moves along just fine, but you do have to stress it to get anywhere and at $8,000 on up for a rebuild, one has to wonder what the point of it all is.

personally i don't get it, but i guess part of it is because it was his first car. plus, i guess they are a good time capsule, representative of what was going on in the 70's. they're a good example of just how fake, empty, and full of meaningless fluff that decade could be.

and to be fair, i'm sure there are people who would question what i'd see in a 1979 new yorker. heck, i gotta admit sometimes i question it myself. :p

my buddy with the mark v was asking me why someone would want to hold onto a pinto, in reference to the 1978 pinto that was in that movie shoot i went to over the weekend. but i guess just like how big car and small car people will always be diametrically opposed, maybe pinto people and mark v people will be, too!

truthfully, i can kinda see the charm in both. the mark v i think is a good looking car, and as far as pimpy cars go i think it's quite sleek and tasteful...much moreso than anything cadillac was putting out at the time. but then the pinto just has sort of an anti-status-symbol charm to it. kind of reverse-chic, i guess? heck, i wouldn't mind having one of those little portholed cruising wagons with the german 2.8 v-6. if i could fit in one. i've never tried out a pinto as i can recall."

i can see a granada as being symbolic of 70s hilarity, especially if displayed with the laughable ad campaigns. but if i wanted a granada, i'd go all the way and get a versailles! i remember back about the time i started driving i looked at a granada ess with my dad...it had body color wheels, power everything including moonroof, black on black...it wasn't a horrible looking thing. they wanted maybe $500 for it as it needed some age related maintenance.

when i was about 9 or 10 my dad wanted to seek out a cruising wagon...i remember we test drove a couple. they were only about 10 year old cars at the time, so they weren't in bad shape. of course, something like that wouldn't have been allowed in the driveway. i remember one in particular...black with blue stripes, round window on the side, it was really clean...they wanted like $1200 for it ca. 1987.

when i was really little, maybe 5, i remember my paternal grandma had a pinto, a baby blue hatchback. even at that time, i thought it was really a bad car....probably through listening to my parents. she loved it though...replaced it with an early cavalier. she liked that too, and had 4 other cavaliers up to the time she stopped driving."

at the time, in the late 80's, it was actually the musclecar among my group of friends. but compared to a pinto, '80 accord 4-cyl mustang, 4-cyl fairmont, cavalier, a '79 sunbird, an '83 stanza, tercel, escort, and a neglected '72 dart that could barely go over 50 mph, my 115 hp v-6 malibu didn't have to try very hard.

and while it seemed like a big, roomy car at the time, in more recent times when i've sat in them at swap meets and such, they just don't seem as big inside as i remember. i guess that's the whole ""rose tinted glasses"" thing?

come to think of it, i replaced that malibu with an older car that was superior in just about every respect...a 1969 dart gt! it just had a slant six, but it was faster, got better fuel economy, more reliable, easier to work on, and with the right tires handled at least as good. larger trunk, although it was shallower. it was a little narrower inside, but i'd say front legroom was actually a bit better than the malibu was. rear legroom was worse, but i could still fit back there more easily than i could in, say, a modern w-body. and the ride was a little worse. the steering definintely had that 60's car feel to it, with overboosted steering and no road feel, whereas the malibu did have a much more modern feel to it. and the dart had nonpower drums, compared to power disc/drums for the malibu, but i had no trouble adjusting.

now if i could get that dart back, i would in a heartbeat. but in all honesty, probably not the malibu."
5118,"August 2, 2006 5:59AM",lemko,"a friend of mine had two of those malibus - a 1982 sedan that was purchased new by his parents and had a 229 cid v-6 and a 1980 model he later got on his own with a 267 cid v-8. both were that teal blue color with dark blue cloth interior. during the early '80s, the pennsylvania state police used these malibus. unusually enough, they all came with the factory sport wheels."
5119,"August 2, 2006 6:10AM",qbrozen,"mine was a '79 cj7. i definitely want one of those again!

i still have the windshield assembly (frame, glass, wiper assembly, and light bar) from that jeep, sitting in my parents garage loft for .... 15 years now! waiting for a worthy recipient."
5120,"August 2, 2006 6:14AM",andre1969,"my grandparents had a 1982 malibu wagon with the 229 v-6. they hated it. i didn't think the 229 was really that bad in my '80 coupe, but the wagon probably weighed about 300 pounds more, and by '82 the 229 was down a bit to 110 hp, plus probably had more emissions crap on it.

their previous car was a 1972 impala 4-door hardtop with a 350-2bbl. hardly a powerhouse, but it probably explains why they had so much trouble adjusting to that weak malibu. i remember grandmom figuring out, on a hot april day about 2 months after they bought the car, that the back windows didn't roll down on it, and that really pissed her off. once the ecu went out for the second time, they traded it on an '85 lesabre which was powerful enough and pretty reliable, at least until the typical old/age neglect stuff started to set in.

i do remember seeing some '82-83 malibu police cars around here, used mainly as county cars. i think the county mainly used mopar f- and m-bodies, but some malibus made it into the mix."

5144,"August 3, 2006 6:39AM",lemmer,"i put some 18"" wheels and tires from an rx400h on it. that helped a huge amount. i no longer fear going the speed limit on slightly curved roads.

i am going to look at this 944 turbo today.

more info from an email:

the car is in good mechanical condition and doesn't need any repairs. i've owned the car for 10 years and kept up with all the maintenance. the timing and balance shaft belts have been replaced regularly. all oil leaks have been repaired. the last oil leak was the oil pan gasket which i replaced less than 10k miles ago.

other repairs:
the a/c has been converted to r134a. the compressor has been replaced as well as the head unit.
the tires have maybe 10k on them and are z-rated.
brake master cylinder was also replaced.
i have replaced the clutch master cylinder and slave cylinder. i have not replaced the clutch, but previous original owner said it was replaced. front seats were professionally recovered in a high quality leather look vinyl.

it is original paint. the car has never been wrecked (to my knowledge and i'm 2nd owner) and has a clean carfax. i've included pics of the major dings and sunroof where paint is faded."
5145,"August 3, 2006 6:55AM",lilengineerboy,"for the car that gave rise to the taurus and the accord of the era i would say the styling was modern. all quattros prior to the very late 80s (89 maybe) or early 90s were manual. iirc it was a modified 016 transmission (from vw rabbit/quantum).
the 80s 5000 cs turbo quattro was rated at 150 or 160 hp, 0-60 was in the 8s somewhere and it got reasonable fuel economy. the cruise control never works because the plastic components weren't designed to stand up to that heat (climate control had similar maladies).
from a performance standpoint, the one to get is the '91 audi 200 20 valve avant quattro turbo. it was a precursor to the s4 and s6 and a great motor to swap in earlier vehicles (a ur-quattro perhaps)."
5146,"August 3, 2006 9:41AM",Mr_Shiftright,"the biggest downside to an old audi, even a very nice one, is that they are maintenance-intensive and the parts prices are astounding. i'd get pretty sick of $500 power steering hoses and $1,000 headlights on an s4."
5147,"August 3, 2006 10:40AM",qbrozen,"this '87 300e is pretty close to where i work. ultra low miles ... but $5k is alot for a 20-year-old.

boy oh boy, a $4k civic with a blown engine, rust, bad paint, and a busted windshield! what a deal!

the pics make this cj7 look so clean that it makes me suspicious.

arrrrgggg... i was pretty interested in this supra until i got to the word ""automatic.""

huh. not a project, but that's a heck of a cheap lease. probably one of those 10k per year deals.

too bad no pics of this roadmaster. but, come on, ""future classic""? ha! and can anyone here confirm 24 mpg?? i know gm is notorious for ultra-tall highway gearing ... but that still seems mighty optimistic to me."
5148,"August 3, 2006 10:49AM",Mr_Shiftright,"cgm x hpl x hcf = agm

where claimed gas mileage is 24, x hpl (human propensity to lie)= 1 (constant) x hyperbole correction factor = .75 = your agm or actual gas mileage, or in this case 18 mmpg."
5149,"August 3, 2006 10:51AM",andre1969,"according to the epa website, the '92 roadmaster wagon with the 350 was rated at 16/25. when they went lt-1 for 1994-96, they actually went up a bit to 17/26!

the 350 that they used in 1992 was a tbi unit that wasn't especially powerful...185 hp iirc. but it was pretty torquey, something like 300 foot-pounds. and at a fairly low rpm. so it could move a lot of weight without struggling very hard.

now if you took good care of it all these years and drove it fairly gently, i'd imagine 24 on the highway might still be attainable."
5150,"August 3, 2006 10:58AM",lemmer,"300e - any modern car that is claimed to need a tuneup scares me. what is there to tuneup in a car run by computers? if it is just spark plugs, why not spend a few minutes and a few dollars replacing them?

5162,"August 3, 2006 6:06PM",andre1969,"does fiberglass really save that much weight? for example, i know you can get fiberglass front fenders for the '67-69 dart. but c'mon, even the steel fenders probably only weight like 35-40 pounds each, if that. so how much does fiberglass really save?

now in some low-hp application like that mg, i could understand weight being a bit more important. but as small as those things are, stuff like hoods, fenders, etc are going to weigh less too.

unless i'm just really off with guessing weights? hey, it's happened before. i used to think the dog weighed about 70-75 pounds. until one day i picked him up out of curiosity and stepped on the bathroom scale while holding him and found out that oops, more like 110 pounds. and i wonder why i have back problems. :p"
5163,"August 3, 2006 10:03PM",ghulet,"i'm a bit late to the party with these comments, but at $5000, it should really be a 'no excuses' car, 54k miles or not (meaningless imo on a 20 yo car owned by someone very old, except that probably not much has been done)....needs a/c 'recharge'? (or perhaps a $2000 compressor or condenser, this is the second oldest...well, you know), no radio?, needs a 'tune-up' (the oldest line of...). sadly, i'd rather have my mom's 300e, even with the ugly color and 8x the miles, just cuz i know it's not neglected, and at probably be 1/4 the price. last, every advertised used mercedes on earth, inexplicably, has a 'leather' interior (that one has mb-tex, not that it's a bad thing, but you can tell by the stitch pattern very easily, especially on 124s). i think that's about a $3000-3500 car."
5164,"August 4, 2006 6:24AM",lemmer,"i drove the 944 turbo i posted about yesterday. it is owned by a mechanic. to sum it up: mechanically, great; everything else, not so great.

it needs a paint job. it has the original paint job - no wrecks, no bodywork, just completely worn out paint. the wheels look great and the tires are new. the interior has threadbare carpet, but the seats are good, and the dash is good.

the owner has done all the work on it himself. the car has all of the problem areas fixed - oil leaks, power steering leaks, timing belt/water pump, motor mounts, hardened engines hoses and vacuum lines (from all that turbo heat), etc. he has replaced all of this stuff and a lot more. the car is fast, and the clutch and transmission feel great.

so how much trouble would i be in for? option one is to drive it for a year and leave it alone and sell it on ebay when i get tired of it. option two is to put some $ into carpet and paint. either way, i wouldn't likely keep it more than a year or so, and i want to minimize my losses over that time.

i am going to check out this supposedly no needs 944t. if this car is really as nice as claimed, is it worth $11,000 versus the $5,900 for the other?"
5165,"August 4, 2006 7:17AM",qbrozen,"i like that mg. just locate a new original hood and have it painted.

anyone know offhand what kind of power that i6 put out? is the car a great deal heavier than an mgb?"
5166,"August 4, 2006 7:27AM",lemmer,"i am thinking 137hp with about 250 extra lbs, but i might have imagined that.

it was supposed to be like a healey, but people didn't buy it (literally and figuratively)."
5167,"August 4, 2006 9:02AM",Mr_Shiftright,"the mgc puts out decent power, but it's mostly on the high end. the car is a better highway car than it is a throw around or stoplight type of vehicle.

the engine itself has no relationship to austin healey at all and many parts, like engine and suspension do not interchange with an mgb.

944t -- a shabby porsche is never a good investment. they are basically sale-proof unless deeply discounted, and i don't think you're going to make a $5,000 944 into an $11,000 944 by merely adding $6,000....if you buy the $5k car and something mechanical comes up, you're sunk in a hole you've never get out of. but if you buy the very sharp $11,000 car, you can repair the problem and still bail out even or slightly behind."

for instance, just about any used car is now automatically junk if it needs an engine.

all the easy projects have been done already it seems.

5191,"August 5, 2006 2:42PM",ghulet,"i love that 560sl, and the price seems 'correct' (i still see lots of these a bit over $20k 'asking', which seems a bit dear for any 20 year-old car, and since its predecessor is in the same ballpark pricewise). i saw one today, also, though it was in a rather boring silver with black (i think) interior."
5192,"August 5, 2006 2:51PM",ghulet,"...though probably not so much with an automatic, and i think the price is a bit high, though in this condition with these miles, this has become a 'hard-to-find':

5193,"August 5, 2006 3:04PM",fintail,"sometimes i think i wouldn't mind having a 560sl...probably just the weather getting to me as this summer has been very nice here. that signal red color is indeed unusual on one of those, too. it'd be a hard choice between that and a 113.

that acura is a rare bird in that condition. just about all of those are trashed in this area, or are really miled up. if you could negotiate it a bit...i think you could do worse for the money.

the whole idea is for us to find potential projects and then talk about whether is viable or not, right? based on the number of projects we manage to find that get the ""fold 'em"" vote, it just goes to show you how tough it really is.

i think there were a couple back there where the census was ""eh, you may be alright if ..."" but, no, i don't think there has been one at all that was ""yes! that would be a great project!""

and, frankly, i'm not surprised. finding a rust-free hemicuda stashed in a barn and buying it off the poor [non-permissible content removed] for $300 is like getting hit with lightning, and i'd say most likely a thing of the past (you can thank barrett-jackson and the speed channel). the discussion may get hit with lightning at some point. you never know."

i am getting less picky about what it is at this point. one idea is to get a 2002 from california and having one of my friends out there bring it back here. it just has to be able to hold my interest and not financially wreck me. its not going to be a daily driver so that gives me a lot of freedom.
i'm still looking for the barn fresh 356 or 73 911s but alas, i'm not real hopeful (and if i did find it, i don't think i would try to do either one myself... which defeats the purpose here)"

5200,"August 6, 2006 11:40AM",Mr_Shiftright,"you really don't want a 356 or 911 out of a barn. these cars in particular suffer mightily from long term careless storage. between the frozen calipers and the possibly damaged engine (flat engines don't like to sit there with moisture getting into the cylinders---they freeze the rings on the bottom side of the piston to the piston liners and that's $$$). you can't come out alive on an old porsche unless you have a running engine that can be tested and certified okay---because rebuilds are $8,000 on up for 4 cylinders and $10,000 on up for the 6s. and they are not volkswagon engines when you take them apart either--much more complex and requiring a high level of machining and precision assembly---an old vw engine, you can just slam those together in comparison. a porsche engine built by a vw mechanic will probably blow up.

2002s are all over the place in california. figure a decent one is $4,000 and up. but even a project would be okay if you don't have rust. there's a decent aftermarket for mechanical parts and some trim pieces for a 2002."
5201,"August 6, 2006 4:24PM",andre1969,"1996 is actually the year to get if you really want an impala ss. iirc, the 1994 had a column shifter and no tach. for 1995 they added a floor shift, but the tach didn't show up until 1996. minor details to be sure, but i've heard it's enough to make a difference.

i like the impala ss, but personally i'd just go get a '94-96 caprice or roadhazzard for a fraction of the price, and essentially end up with the same performance. a wolf in sheep's clothing, in essence.

i always thought it would be cool to take that lt-1 drivetrain and plant it in the older, boxier, lighter, '77-90 caprice. or better yet, a '78-81 malibu coupe. i'm sure that by now it's been done...i'd imagine that if i thought of it, there are probably plenty of people that have already done it."
5202,"August 6, 2006 4:33PM",qbrozen,"hmmm... that '69 monaco looks real nice for the money. i wonder what engine it has. i'm guessing not a real potent one or the seller would have an extra zero on that price.

if there's no rust underneath, i think i'd be interested no matter what engine it had (as long as it runs, that is)."
5203,"August 6, 2006 4:41PM",andre1969,"i like that '69 dodge monaco, especially for $900! those ""fuselage"" era '69-73 mopars usually didn't excite me, although i find that, with age, i do appreciate them more. there's something aout the '69 monaco i always liked though. i think the stylists did a good job at hiding its fatness. somehow it just comes off a bit sleeker to me than a '69 plymouth or chrysler.

oh, if i had about $1000-1500 burning a hole in my pocket, i saw a few vehicles for sale at a car show in macungie, pa that caught my eye.

first was a 1974 new yorker 4-door hardtop. it needed a good cleaning, and to be honest wasn't the most beautiful thing in the world, but i kinda liked it. had a 440-4bbl, and the only rust i could find was in the lower part of the rear quarters, which was common on these things. that part is almost horizontal, so you have to practically get up under the car to see it. i know they say that in the late 70's when cars got downsized, they became more space-efficient and in some cases were actually roomier. still, this sucker felt huge inside compared to my '79 nyer. harder to get into and out of, but once you were inside the legroom was expansive.

second was a 1977 gm pickup. i can't remember now if it was a chevy or gmc. it was a 3/4 ton, 8-foot bed, 350, 4wd, 8400 lb gvwr. looked like it had less rust on it than my '85 silverado, but it was extremely spartan inside. still kinda tempting, though

third was a 1981 dodge diplomat coupe. bucket seats and a floor shift. didn't say what engine it had, but i looked under and saw a crossover pipe, so i'm sure it was a 318. it actually looked like it was in really good shape.

4th was a 1964 olds 88 4-door sedan. a good 50-footer, but up close some of the ""repair"" in the rear quarters involved electrical tape! i always liked the '64 olds...kinda makes me think of a lincoln in a way.

all of these cars were priced around $2000-2200 which, i thought, was at least somewhat grounded in reality. at least these people weren't thinking they had rare collectibles or something!"
5204,"August 6, 2006 4:46PM",andre1969,"i was curious about that '69 monaco too, so i looked it up in my old car book. looks like that year, the monaco was kind of an upscale dodge, with the polara being the lower-level big model.

the monaco had a 383 standard, with 290 hp. i'm guessing that was a 2-bbl.

optional was a 383 with 330 hp (4-bbl most likely). you could also get a 440 with 350 or 375 hp. i think they were both 4-bbls, but one just had a hotter state of tune.

the polara, otoh, had a 318-2bbl with 230 hp standard, with all those other engines optional. the slant six was limited to darts and intermediates.

so it looks like you can't go wrong with that monaco. even the suckiest engine really doesn't suck. except probably gasoline! :shades:"

i do find the 740s cheap ... but that's mostly because i know how to work on it. they are more reliable than my s70, yet most of the important stuff is identical between the 2 (yeah, the statement seems contradictory - but the biggest problems were all the extra stuff they added to the 740 to make it a ""new model"")."

it took a while to talk my friend down from the last car, but now that we have seen a lot of ads that look good for cars in $7-9k range, he has given up on the $12k car with the worn paint job."
5224,"August 7, 2006 10:23AM",andre1969,"that '52 desoto, too. too bad it's not a firedome though. when i was a kid, my granddad had a '53 firedome, which i think was about the peak of the '49-54 style. he sold the thing just about the time i hit driving age, and i'm still a bit miffed about it sometimes. i know where the car is, but it's been sitting about 20 years at the edge of a forest, and hasn't been run since the guy tried to jump start it with a 12-volt system and fried it, soon after he bought it from granddad.

if you wanted to take something like that and convert it over to a 12-volt system, what all would you have to change? distributor, coil, starter, and generator maybe? anything else? i know they didn't have fuse boxes back then, but had fusible links or something like that. would all that other wiring, like what goes to the lights, radio, heater and such have to be upgraded, as well?"

5249,"August 8, 2006 6:19AM",qbrozen,"so a friend of mine just leased a new highlander and wishes to sell his '96 civic dx coupe automatic with about 115k miles.

now, i know this car, and it has been in an accident in the past (it was stolen, actually, and when the joyriding thieves were through with it, they courteously parked it on top of a highway dividing wall). $2k of work was done to it at that time, but not everything was fixed as i know it needs a new front suspension and i believe a cv assembly. the theft was a few years ago, so they've been driving it without a problem since then, but that thing does not currently feel like a civic should.

sooo... here's the question: do i take him up on his offer of buying it for $1k? i figure its a $3k or $3500 car without this history or current problems. my intention would be to fix it and flip it.

my wife says no way ... but i'd like a 2nd opinion that is more objective."
5250,"August 8, 2006 6:34AM",andre1969,that '74 benz was the awkward hardtop model. i notice the seller conveniently took the pics at an angle to disguise that fact at a quick glance. at first i thought it was one of those little 2-seaters with the hard top in place.
5251,"August 8, 2006 6:38AM",gsemike,"""it needs a new front suspension and i believe a cv assembly""

does it absolutely look good besides that? it sounds like you're talking about a grands worth of work so you should be able to make a grand on it. if you've got the time it sounds like a decent proposition."
5252,"August 8, 2006 6:40AM",qbrozen,"i haven't looked at the prices of parts yet - is that $1k just parts or are you talking parts and labor.

5255,"August 8, 2006 8:47AM",qbrozen,"well.... honestly, i'm beginning to talk myself out of it.

loaded up a shopping cart at my favorite online parts dealer with what i believe the car may need to begin with (cv, shocks, control arms) to the tune of $800. it then dawned on me that this car may very well be in need of a timing belt as well. sure, not exactly a task that will break the bank as far as parts go, but its also a task i hate doing (i'd love nothing more than to avoid changing another timing belt for the rest of my life).

so... anyway, now i'm thinking, to do it right, i might be looking at $2k when all is said and done and maybe 20 or so hours of my time. if i equate that to a reasonable $25/hr, we're talking $500 in my labor.

is the car worth $2500 with the history it possesses? i'd say that's debatable. but certainly no longer the screaming bargain i thought it might be.

opinions?"
5256,"August 8, 2006 8:59AM",lemmer,"if you are doing it to make money, i say don't do it.

if you are doing it because you want to mess around with and drive a civic for a short time at no cost to you, then do it.

you could probably buy it and sell it as is on ebay for a decent profit."
5257,"August 8, 2006 9:05AM",qbrozen,"yes, it would be for resale. we can't afford another car right now. besides, if i was getting an old civic for myself, it would not be an automatic!

i've definitely thought about selling it as is ... but i know i won't be able to do it.

i have a problem with selling a car that needs repairs that i know it needs and could do if i wanted. its like when i sold my volvo and did a ton of work on it beforehand. i had several people ask me ""why are you selling it if you've done all this work recently?"" my answer is, i did all this because i'm selling. they find that hard to believe. *shrug*"

$2500 for that w124 looks ok...car looks nice in the pics. the w123 coupe is about triple price, at the least. the interior looks pretty shot too...the car has likely been sun baked.

5265,"August 8, 2006 10:54AM",qbrozen,huh. i didn't even notice it was the same seller. i wonder what else he's got in that garage.
5266,"August 8, 2006 11:09AM",andre1969,"really unit-bodied? that would seem strange to me. with the exception of stuff like the ford falcon, the australian mopar ute, the rabbit and rampage pickups, and other car-based stuff, there has never been a true unit-bodied pickup that i know of.

some might point to the jeep commanche of the 80's or the honda ridgeline of today. however, the commanche had some pretty substantial frame rails welded up underneath it to connect the bed with the cab, while the ridgeline has a complete frame underneath it from stem to stern. they might call them unibody, but examples like this just drive home the point that body-on-frame is usually the way to go when building a pickup."
5267,"August 8, 2006 11:53AM",bumpy,"it's called a ""unibody"" because the cab and bed are one piece, rather than being separate assemblies. it's still body-on-frame. ford built the f-series pickups that way for a few years in the early '60s. unfortunately, that makes it a giant pain in the butt to repair or replace the bed, so the only ones worth fixing up are the ones that don't need fixing up."
5268,"August 8, 2006 12:01PM",andre1969,"okay, gotcha. that kinda makes sense now...""unibody"" in the sens of the cab being joined with the bed, as opposed to any reference to the underlying structure.

i'd imagine that must've been an expensive way to build the trucks. i always thought the main reason they build pickups with the bed being separate is so that the cab can be used in a variety of applications, such as medium duty trucks and so forth.

i guess building the bed and cab as one piece probably made for a pretty stiff structure...as long as it didn't rust out!"

it's not the rust you see, it's the rust you don't see that you have to worry about.

still the car should be worth $499 you'd think."
5272,"August 8, 2006 1:06PM",bumpy,"the unibody was a styling exercise, and a rather unpopular one after the shortcomings became evident. one problem was that the cab-bed assembly still had a lot of flex in it, and it was possible to get the frame and body off-aligned enough to pinch the doors shut. ford made a separate wide bed available in '63 (the fender-side beds were always separate) and abandoned the unibody for '64.

i thought this was funny, mostly because i just bought a good running, decent looking, undamaged, loaded '95 saturn sl2 with a couple of minor issues (broken sunroof and radio, might need tires and brakes at some point) for $400, so this price struck me as a bit of a pipe dream for the seller:

this thing is for the junk yard, imo (how many people are going to take an engine that might be ok out of a trashed '94 saturn to put in another one that's worth ~$1-2k in good condition?)."

5280,"August 8, 2006 6:03PM",Mr_Shiftright,"hmmm...i'd say you paid over retail which is not so good, but on the other hand, i think the 'blue book' doesn't really take into account that most cars under $2,000 today are trash.

so i think you can sell this car for what you paid but you'll have to have the buyer seeing the car and you'll have to put your polish on the sale--getting $2900 will require some effort but is do-able. the problem is that between the high price and the ""drop"" and the stickshift you have narrowed your pool of buyers with three factors.

does that make sense?"
5281,"August 8, 2006 6:30PM",steine13,"unfortunately, it does make sense.

if it really gets on my nerves, i'll run it through the local auction and cut my losses... without the drop, it would not only be a very good deal, i'd keep it. good deal in terms of what you get for the money, not $$$ paid vs. cash value.

a buddy bought a '68 vette that had a lot of engine and suspension mods for racing. the seller had all the original parts oiled and wrapped in heavy paper. buddy put everything back to stock and had a stock '68 427 vette to play with for a couple of years before selling."
5283,"August 8, 2006 6:52PM",british_rover,i am thinking junk yard run to find a prizm that got hit in the rear and one that got hit in the front. just pull the parts off of the junk cars should hardly cost you anything.

on the subject of lemanses, i want you guys' opinions on something. tell me which grille you guys prefer...

this:


or this:


reason i'm asking is because personally, i've always preferred the first style, which is the base '76 lemans. i always liked the look with each insert having the one bold horizontal bar that gave it kind of a crosshair look, and with the background kinda blacked out. i bought a set of these inserts to put on my car. now it wouldn't be ""correct"", but when you figure my '76 is wearing a '77 grand lemans grille, it's not exactly ""correct"" as it stands now!

the more i look at the front of mine though, the more i like its grille, too, so i've been reluctant to change it."

speaking of porsches --- so this guy in the neighborhood decides he wants to put a porsche 928 gts engine in his clean but weak-motored '86 928.

so he finds one on ebay---""all checked out"", ""runs beautifully"" blah blah....and he buys it for $8,000 without hearing it run (it's already out of the car).

well, he gets the engine and sends it to my friend's shop. they notice a lot of sealant on the oil pan and say ""hmmmm....let's have a peak in there before we install"".

inside there are pieces of connecting rod and bearing---one cylinder has a shattered rod and ruined crank throw and you can see where other bearings were so hot they have discolored the bearing caps.

nasty business on ebay, hah?"

5290,"August 9, 2006 8:09AM",qbrozen,what kind of feedback did the seller have? how far away does the seller live? did your friend use paypal? did he actually complete the transaction on ebay or did he buy it outside of the auction?
5291,"August 9, 2006 8:19AM",Mr_Shiftright,"don't know the details. he's not much of a friend so i'm not comfortable interrogating him. i think he was way too reckless, he just got blinded by seeing exactly what he wanted.

there is a theory of brain behavior which suggests that desire distorts the object of that desire. he wasn't looking at what was there, but what he wanted--otherwise he might have noticed the numerous irregularities on that engine that i was able to spot easily just looking at it....the oil pan goop, and white valve covers painted badly, etc.

i honestly like this

if it doesn't have a rotted frame or anything severe like that, i like this for $5,000. this car has to be worth the mid to high teens once it's up to no 3 shape.

this malibu i'm not so crazy about.

alledgedly rolling chassis

what's so precious about the steeting box that he's got to take it out?

one last one:

3 inch cowl hood and 2.8 liter v6 go well together.

malibu - couple of hundred dollars in body parts, i guess. apparently it isn't worth the money as a complete car or he wouldn't have taken out every single mechanical part, including the apparently very important steering box.

camaro - what a pile. junkyard time."
5309,"August 10, 2006 5:59AM",andre1969,"but that 1980 malibu has 1979 taillights on it. and i don't think i've ever seen an '80 in quite that shade of blue, but i have seen '79's in that color.

not that there's really any difference in value most likely between a '79 and an '80 malibu. i had an '80, and it wasn't a bad car. i like the '79 style a bit better though because the grille is a bit less formal and the front-end has a more aggressive thrust to it.

i'd imagine the thing originally had a junk 200 v-6 or 267 v-8 in it, hooked to the sucky thm200c tranny, and he pulled that out and was going to build this into a hotrod. it's actually pretty common to do that with 1978-81 malibus, because they're about the smallest, lightest body-on-frame car that gm ever made, and can accommodate a big-block. as for the steering box, maybe he had installed a quicker ratio unit out of a copcar or maybe a grand national, monte ss or something, and wants to hang onto it. i'd think he'd want to keep the grand national rear as well, but it's probably easier to sell a non-running car that can still roll, versus one that can't!

back then they also offered a 305 v-8 that put out, iirc, 145 hp with the 2-bbl and 160 with the 4-bbl. a 350 was also optional but seldom ordered. it had 170 hp, which doesn't sound that much better than the 305-4, but i'm sure it had a lot more torque.

i get nostalgic for my old malibu sometimes, but not enough to go seek out one that needs a total rebuild! besides, i have fond memories of that car and remember is as a good car. if i had a chance to drive one nowadays, it would probably crack my rose-tinted glasses! :shades:"
5310,"August 10, 2006 6:07AM",jlflemmons,"if you are being picky, then so am i. that circus colored ""'71 cutlass"" in an earlier post had '72 tail lights.

i had a '79 cutlass calais (rwd) with the chevy 305 4bbl. it ran good, but an intake design flaw would cause the #8 plug to fuel foul every 5k or so. gm mechanic said it was a common problem on the '79 305.

funny thing about that th200 tranny. from day one, mine had a very soft ""whirring"" sound under hard acceleration, particularly 2nd gear. but 74k miles later i had not a single problem with it. go figure.

clone cars have become a big thing and sometimes problem on the collector car circuit. if we're at the point where people are cloning 79 malibus out of 80s, we're out of control.

i of course would like to see the mustang have an interior. it's not in condition where you could drive it home but practically everything is available repro. let's say 3 grand later, the car has a pristine interior, you're still in pretty good shape."

my 1980 malibu had that th200 tranny, and i never recall it having any problems. my mom bought it new, gave it to me in 1987 with around 79,000 miles on it, and i sold it in 1990 when it was a bit over the 100,000 mile mark. i had bought a 1969 dodge dart gt by then, and couldn't afford to keep both cars. i ran into the people i sold it to about a year later, and they had 115,000 miles on it, and said they loved it and hadn't had any problems with it.

but then, i had a 1982 cutlass supreme with the ""superior"" thm350 tranny. and had it rebuilt around the 62,000 mile mark. so sometimes ya just never know. now to be fair, i bought this car used, in 1993, with 61,000 miles on it, for $800, so it may simply not have been taken care of. in contrast, i remember mom got the tranny serviced on the malibu every year, and once she gave it to me i kept up on that.

both of them just had v-6es, as well. 229 for the malibu, 231 for the cutlass. i wondered if just having the v-6 in the 'bu might have also contributed to the long transmission life, whereas a v-8 might have put more strain on it?

as for that #8 plug fouling, was it a 1979-only problem? reason i'm asking is that i have a 1985 silverado with a 305, and i wonder if it might do the same thing? hopefully gm had the foresight to correct it by then!"
5313,"August 10, 2006 6:47AM",jlflemmons,"the '85 engine bears little resemblence to the '79. '79 was the last year without an ecm onboard.

we had an '83 calais with the olds 307 and th350 (i think) and never had problems with it, either. come to think of it, my family has owned about 12 cutlass' between us, and all were solid performers.

do you remember if that '83 calais had overdrive or not? if it was an overdrive unit, then it was actually a 4-speed version of the thm200. i think they called it thm200-r4 or osmething like that. earlier versions of this tranny, which came out in 1981, could be troubleprone, but in a rare move i think gm actually got on the ball and worked the kinks out of this tranny pretty quickly. my grandma had a 1985 lesabre 307 with this tranny, that was troublefree as long as we had the car, 157,000 miles. my mom had an '86 monte with a 305-4bbl and this tranny, and it was still doing fine at 192,000 miles when i got t-boned one night delivering pizzas in it and the car went to bow-tie heaven.

i wouldn't mind getting another cutlass supreme coupe sometime, but with the 307 instead of the v-6. in spite of the tranny pooping out and the engine self-destructing, i really liked that car."

i think it's better @ 3500 than 5, but you have to think of the ceiling. v8 mustang convertibles can go for a great deal of money. show quality would probably fetch in the 20s or higher.

i wonder about the interior parts are well. if you're planning on restoring the car, you just don't put everything in a dumpster yet he doesn't mention the parts. you'd at least hold on to the seats to see about having them redone. maybe he's selling whatever is good separately.

5319,"August 10, 2006 8:06AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i think you should take a more sober look at that mustang mike--i don't see the wisdom of this purchase myself. you can't build a nice car out of a car with a poor foundation. i see a lot of work here---did you notice the bashed in inner fender wells in the engine compartment? and it looks like there is no window hardware in the doors. and i see evidence of rust. what's it like underneath?
and the engine looks suspicious---might not be the right one.

sure you can get $30,000 for a really spiff '68 mustang convertible, but you'll spend $30,000 on this one getting there....

i'd say if it ran well and had an interior, even a shabby one, and windows that worked, it'd be worth $5,000 to just drive around and leave the top down in the rain like the previous owner obviously did.

anyway, if you got this as is with a parts car included for $3,500, that might be okay. but you'll never make a nice car out of this stray dog without taking it completely apart, imho.

if it were a numbers correct 65-67 gt with a 4-speed, i'd say go for it."
5320,"August 10, 2006 9:47AM",qbrozen,"would make for a good winter beater. looks to be in nice shape, too.

why do all this just to sell it for $4k??

i noticed this at its first price ... looks much better at the new price.

ya gotta worry when the paint doesn't even look good from this far away!

just because you think its desirable, doesn't mean it is. yes, its rare. yes, some folks actually look to buy the bertones ... but no way is it worth that!!

here's a car where you just can't be skimpy on the description and pics like this.

is it just me or does this seem too cheap? may be a scam, but they usually seem to use more recent or more desirable cars. although its the same layout as most of the scams (vin included). i'll email and find out."
5321,"August 10, 2006 9:50AM",michaellno,"wow, the subie seems to be way underpriced! here in co, i could probably get that for my fil's '92 (or is it a '93?) legacy wagon with 135k."
5322,"August 10, 2006 9:56AM",qbrozen,"if we had some sort of local rallycross, i'd be all over it."
5323,"August 10, 2006 10:11AM",british_rover,yeah that is hardly any rally cross activity up here either. very depressing. we have a some what active snow cross club that i want to take a range rover sport to one day. i think it would be kind of funny to drive one around their course.
5324,"August 10, 2006 10:38AM",andre1969,"on the subaru kool-aid, but even i kinda like that legacy outback for the price!"
5325,"August 10, 2006 10:58AM",andre1969,"but a tad bit pricey.

who the hell buys something like this and then puts it away for nearly 30 years? :confuse:"
5326,"August 10, 2006 11:22AM",fintail,"that outback looks like a bargain....you could easily double that price here among all the subie nuts.

cool old squire, but yeah his price is a few times too high.

nice late fintail...rare floor shift"
5327,"August 10, 2006 11:28AM",andre1969,"with those fintails, are the ones that have the single headlight actually smaller overall than the ones with the stacked headlights? or is it just a styling trick?

for some reason the single-headlight models look too stubby to me, whereas the ones with the vertical quads look ""just right"""
5328,"August 10, 2006 12:07PM",Mr_Shiftright,"man i'm with you. a subaru is about the last car i'd consider owning. i find them very clunky, and the wrx sti is a rough piece of work.

looks like that ad was yanked by management."
5329,"August 10, 2006 12:07PM",qbrozen,"i don't believe for a second its only 600 miles.

like you said, who would do that?

even if by some odd stroke of weird fate, it does only have 600 miles, there is no way to prove it."
5330,"August 10, 2006 12:10PM",qbrozen,"yanked? the subie? huh. i just tried the link and it worked. strange.

another strange thing is that i've tried emailing the seller twice on that sc400 and craigslist mailer demon has kicked it back twice ... yet the ad still stands and the address has not changed. hmmmm..."
5331,"August 10, 2006 12:14PM",andre1969,"low mileage wonder. this one's even more hysterical, at only 51 miles! price seems more reasonable, though. i kinda like this one. i always thought that dove gray looked good on those overblown grand marquises. nice, cushy interior too!

if i had more money than i knew what to do with, i think i'd actually consider this one."
5332,"August 10, 2006 12:16PM",Mr_Shiftright,"i'm getting this message on the subaru link:

""this posting has been removed by craigslist staff.""

low mileage wonders: i mean, who cares how many miles a 1978 ford station wagon has on it? like it matters? try $5,000."
5333,"August 10, 2006 12:27PM",qbrozen,"that's weird. its still working for me. i even ran a search on craigs and it came up with no problem. the sc400 link still works, too, but i tried to search for that and it didn't come up.

maybe craigs is glitching today ... or maybe its me."

shifty, the wrx sti is a bit rough, but when you pay extra to have all the sound deadening/heat insulation removed, what do you expect?"
5338,"August 10, 2006 12:48PM",xwesx,"sadly, i recognize that truck! as a child, i used to see it in the ""dress up parade"" that kicked off round-up week in pendleton. hahaha. what a small world..."
5339,"August 10, 2006 12:54PM",xwesx,"no, at that price, i bet you anything it has a head gasket issue. granted, to replace those gaskets is a few hour project at best, but still.... it would be a project. i'm sure i could probably get that, or close, ($2600) out of mine today and it has 212k miles and a few visual blemishes.

the hg problem was an issue in the 2.5l from its intro in 1996 until at least 2002 (if it was a problem after that, not cropping up enough yet to be recognized by subaru). they put out a tsb on '99 through part of '02. only. a real stab in the back for the '96 through '98 owners.

anyway, if this one did not have any problems as the owner suggests, i'd be tempted to fly down there and buy it just to have a car with 50% the miles! it probably does not have the best fit/finish of all the makes, but i've seen scarce few cars that can compare to it in winter driving - and i live for winter driving..."
5340,"August 10, 2006 12:58PM",xwesx,"no kidding..... it says ""all original service records."" service records? if it needed service in 600 miles of use, that worries me...... :p"
5341,"August 10, 2006 1:35PM",Mr_Shiftright,"you get yourself a good audi quattro, it'll perform equally or outperform a subaru. and you can have build quality instead of reliability, but you can't have both!!

wrx-- yeah, i often wondered why someone thought that taking out 30 lbs of sound-deadening was really the competitive edge while driving to the mall. the evo has a similar model (was it the rs?)...if you open the trunk you can see the springs on the back seat!"
5342,"August 10, 2006 1:46PM",qbrozen,"granted, to replace those gaskets is a few hour project at best

really? i'd be surprised.

just replacing the timing belt on our '98 forester took me and my father a few hours. what an annoying task! lining up 4 cams and keeping them in place while trying to snake on the belt drove me to kick the car several times."

5344,"August 10, 2006 2:05PM",fintail,"yep...the single light cars are actually considered to be a different platform, a w110. they are a couple inches shorter, but are identical from the front doors back (save for trim etc).

something not seen every day"
5345,"August 10, 2006 2:12PM",fintail,"wow, that's a crazy coincidence. i have yet to see a car i know on cl.

about that squire, i bet the miles are real. i bet it was saved by some kooky dealer who saw it as the last of the big fullsized cars before the downsized 79s came about. the same people who saved all those 78 eldos you can now find with no mileage."
5346,"August 10, 2006 3:02PM",ghulet,"....but i like that this is a 5-speed, that the seller is honest about its flaws, and the price is pretty good, imo:

5347,"August 10, 2006 4:19PM",xwesx,"well..... i might have been exaggerating a little bit. i have re-placed the timing belt on mine 5 times now, so that is more routine than anything, but it was a definite pain the first couple times. i could probably go from start-to-finish on a timing belt replacement now in 2 hours - maybe 3 if i ran into some stubborn bolts or other unforseen problems. now for the gaskets, more like 12 hours depending on how strickly in-and-out one wanted to go, but certainly not anything exceptionally taxing.

grr. i have to stop thinking about it because really, i am tempted - but the kicker is that it would have to be in honestly reliable enough condition for a quick 4500 mile sprint back to alaska. :mad:"

5349,"August 10, 2006 4:44PM",Mr_Shiftright,"not bad but that one line, that one tiny line in the ad sends shivers through me:

now let's take that line apart a bit. are the fuses like...too heavy to lift into the fuse box? were they too expensive?

or, in fact, when you put a fuse in it goes pop! and then you get a whiff of smoke from the wiring harness and no radio, no dash lights, no tail lights, no heater blower and no top......"

5356,"August 11, 2006 5:12AM",andre1969,"the flush/composite headlight model was called the ls, for ""luxury sport"", and was offered from 1986-1988. it slotted in between the base sport coupe and the ss. i know that in 1986 you could still get the base sport coupe, with the old rectangular headlights, because that's what i had. however, i dunno if you could still get it in 1988.

1988 was a very abbreviated year for the monte. production wrapped up by december of 1987, and gm only ran off about 25,000 montes that year. i thought they were all lses and sses, but i guess it's possible the base sport coupe lasted through then. anybody got a reference book handy?

the ls also had a nicer velour interior, and not that ""wet rat"" look that seemed to permeate the base model and the ss. and the ls had ss-style taillights, which were a bit sleeker than the base monte.

that model year they also ran off about 25,000 cutlass supreme ""classics"". however, the rwd regal and grand prix finished up in 1987. for some reason, pontiac and buick got their fwd w-bodies to the market a few months sooner than olds. and chevy wouldn't make it until 1990, with the lumina."

of course you still have warranty, and that's a very good thing on a domestic car. i wouldn't see this car as serving you for more than a few years though. why don't you check on depreciation values and see how that looks--maybe you could buy it and then bail at 50,000 and get the best part out of the car for yourself and still recover some $$$ for what will probably still be relatively low miles in the year 2009."
5363,"August 11, 2006 7:47AM",qbrozen,"well, hell, if you'll just resell it down the line, don't buy it. the car will continue to depreciate like day-old bread. my guess is you could stick it in a garage and never drive it and it will still drop another $15k in the next 3 years."

5372,"August 11, 2006 8:47AM",Mr_Shiftright,"unfortunate color on the tiger...well at least he has the certificate of authenticity. these cars can be easily faked and the fakes are difficult to spot...you have to snoop around underneath and checked for welded up battery boxes, etc. the vin won't tell you anything. so beware of buying a tarted up alpine made into a tiger...we call them ""algers"". he might get the low $20ks but $29k seems unlikely. fun car to drive? well, sorta, if you like steering with the gas pedal and having your shins burned off.

karmann ghia -- wasn't that the name of the gay choreographer's assistant in mel brooks ""the producers""? funny movie.

ghias are cheap to repair mechanically but not cosmetically. they are unibodies and the fenders don't come off like on a bug. also, any trim pieces are very very expensive. so all in all, not an easy restoration if you have to re-work the body or replace missing pieces. your best friend will be a welding torch."

fer instance, if i had a car with 10,000 miles and told you a connecting rod went through the hood, you'd say ""oh, man, that's pretty unusual""....but if i told you on that 240sx thta the engine disintegrated on the highway, you'd say ""well what do you expect for 155,000 miles?"""
5377,"August 11, 2006 10:32AM",xwesx,"this is a case of a ""seller"" not really wanting to sell something. he figures that since it was so well maintained all these years, someone else should pay for it. i would say $3500 tops for this one - even if it is the best example out there. :sick:

my grandmother had one of these that, other than the color (and it being a '91), could have been its twin. she traded it on a 1997 f350 crew lb that had a ""waldoch"" conversion on it. the dealership wanted $46,000 for the truck and she ended up paying $31k out the door. i have no idea how the dealership wrote up the trade-in value, but she swears she got $15,000 for her lincoln. hahah... i hate to tell her otherwise.... :blush:"
5378,"August 11, 2006 10:33AM",bumpy,"the timing chain on the ka24de usually craps out around 175k, but otherwise the entire drivetrain was well overengineered. the bushings and suspension bits will have to start being replaced before too long, but that's true of any car driven for ten years. the 240sx is the kind of car that rewards such attention."
5379,"August 11, 2006 11:38AM",andre1969,"that this is kinda purty. i think the red interior contrasts nicely with the silver. this is the front-end that my '76 should have. looks like it has cloth seats, too.

5385,"August 12, 2006 8:43AM",andre1969,"yes, the current town car is a whopping five inches shorter than a '90, if we're going to split hairs

yeah, i thought that was kinda funny, too! however, one thing i noticed, last time i sat in a town car at the auto show, is they just don't seem as roomy inside as what i remember the older ones being. unless i'm still growing, which i would hope not at the age of 36!

just for kicks (and to kill time, waiting for my garage floor to dry out so i can finally paint it...yay!), i looked up some interior volume specs on www.fueleconomy.gov.

2006 town car: 112/21 (passenger/trunk volume)
1990 town car: 118/22
1985 town car: 116/22

so it actually is smaller inside. not enough to make it noticeable for most people, i'd imagine. i wonder what they did to it with the latest style to make it lose 6 cubic feet of interior space? a foot of trunk room is pretty inconsequential at that size. iirc, the 2007 camry lost something like 2 cubic feet, going from ~17 to ~15. that would be more noticeable.

just for comparison the biggest car in my fleet, my '79 nyer is something like 108/21 iirc so i guess i shouldn't whine about the new town car not being roomy enough. especially when you consider my nyer rides a slightly longer wheelbase and i think it's about 5-6 inches longer.

i think the newer cars get a lot of that interior volume because they're tall, though. that's not necessarily going to make a car feel bigger inside like more legroom or shoulder room would.

last weekend i sat in a 1974 nyer 4-door hardtop. i found some specs once on a '78, and it was only epa-rated at around 106/22! yet that sucker felt huge inside to me! it was harder to get into and out of than a newer car because the doors were thick and the openings weren't that big, and the whole car sits kinda low. but once inside, it just felt vast compared to any car built today.

still, having a few more cubic feet of interior room doesn't justify the high price they want for that ""classic"" 1990! :p"
5386,"August 12, 2006 8:57AM",Mr_Shiftright,"the tr7 is so pathetic that experienced mechanics recommend you install 2 or three head gaskets to try and keep the head from warping. that is so sad. problem? bad engineering...the head bolts are drilled diagonally, and there's not enough of them to hold the head down properly.

back then though, suvs tended to be more rugged looking, trucky things so the benz m class probably swayed more towards minivan than suv in styling at the time, anyway.

i do remember when that kia sorrento came out, thinking that it looked a lot more expensive and upscale than it really was. perhaps a ripoff of the m class, but more attractive stylistically imo. and now that the m has been redesigned, i hate to say it, but even though i think it's better looking, i still mistake them for kias at a quick glance! :blush:"

tr7 -- the tr8 is more desirable, but that lame buick 215 is no great shakes either--it has its own set of horrible problems...rover did major development on that engine over the years, and finally achieved mediocrity with it. best avoid these cars altogether like most sensible people do.

datsun b210 -- it would make a great disposable commuter car, or a first-timer for a 16 year old. you could replace the head gasket in nothing flat and the radiator is a simple fix. but $750? i don't think so. try $250.

61 galaxie-- i find this a really unattractive car. thank god for the mustang, or ford would have been dead with dreadful styling like this---compare and contrast to '61 gm products!"

admittedly, the coupes looked a lot better, but the ford starliner wasn't ugly either. ford does seem to have had a stodgier image though....i suspect those 62-64 midsize gm coupes like impalas etc were much more trendy than their fomoco counterparts.

i was thinking $50 was right for that b210 (i always liked those hubcaps when i was little). my dad's $100 610 is in 10 times better shape. give it a good hard detail and take it to local shows as a freak."

5407,"August 13, 2006 2:22PM",andre1969,"i think ford was trying to go for a bit more of a formal, upscale look which appealed to a certain buyer, while the chevy was a bit more sporty.

if anything, one thing that might have saved ford's bacon in the early 60's is the fact that mopar was pretty much a no-show in the basic full-sized arena from 1962-64. and the '61 plymouths and dodge darts were goofy enough to send buyers to ford and chevy in droves.

now i do prefer the '61 chevy to the '61 ford, but i don't think the '61 ford's bad looking. if i were to rate the cars in that category for 1961, it would be something like
#1: chevy
#2: ford
#3: dodge dart (and that's a distant #3)
#4: just about any used car
#5: a bicycle
#6: a pair of chucks
#7: a pair of cheap chuck knock-offs
#8: a bottle of rat-b-gone
#9: a '61 plymouth

i think the 1963 ford is an attractive car. i think for that year i prefer it to the chevy. and for 1964, i think it's a tossup between the ford and the chevy. i don't think either one's ugly, but neither one blows me away with that style, either. i think chevy hits its peak for that bodystyle in 1962, while ford hit theis in 1963."

5409,"August 13, 2006 4:07PM",fintail,"indeed the 63 ford was the peak of that style...the 64 is so busy, and the 62 looks kinda old. i kinda like the 64 with its squared off accents...the 62 is nice too. i don't care for the 63 chevys as much.

funny thing, i just noticed that 61 is wearing hubcaps likely from a late 60s or early 70s ford pickup. i know this as my first car, a 66 galaxie, came with 2 sets of caps - originals and one just like the ones on that 61. i was at a junkyard where the caps were sorted by make and approximate year, and those were grouped as a period ford truck.

might be nice

yeah it's odd and cool in its own way...but calm down"
5410,"August 13, 2006 5:07PM",Mr_Shiftright,"$1 for the subaru brat? i'd pay that.

'61 chevy is a nice looking car...it's pretty classic 60s stuff. the 61 ford is sheer chaos to me, a hodge-podge of styling events. looks like the clay model fell on the floor and they kind of patched it up before the boss got there."
5411,"August 13, 2006 7:50PM",gsemike,"i would take that in a minute for 11 grand if it looks that good in person. even if it's a clone, that's a nice car."
5412,"August 13, 2006 7:51PM",ghulet,"...with the '61 ford, at least that model, is that it's an early-60s car on top (decent thin-pillared period greenhouse) laid atop some pretty bad leftover '50s styling cliches (clunky chrome under the trunk, tiny afterthought fins with round taillights, bulbous, roundy front end and the slab of chrome trim on the lower rear fenders). it's one of those rare cars where i like the lower trim lines better--a custom 300 at least doesn't have all that ugly trim (think first season of 'andy griffith'). i would agree that the same basic car, cleaned up and modernized (the '63) is nice looking. the '62 to me always looked about twice as big as its frame, kind of a hippo riding on 14"" training wheels.

oh yeah, that galaxie has the standard-issue '71-72 ford caps (one of the unusual cases where they were available on the full-sizers, f150 and vans--our '72 club wagon had them).

bmw 530i -- i always wave red flags at mid to late 70s bmws. this era was problematic for bmw and many other manufacturers as well. as i recall the 5 series engines like to crack their cylinder heads, just for fun. but this one looks to be in very nice shape. this is the kind of car you want to test drive real hard for 1/2 hour and play with all the dials and switches before and after. might be okay, although price is a tad optimistic. $2,500 seems more than fair, even for pristine condition. odd duck, hard to find parts, nobody wants to work on them.

my opinion? buy an 80s 325 or 735 and be happier for the same price. more parts, more modern, better fuel mileage."

the 5-series to get is the 528. i think it is from 1978-1981. the earlier 530i (and related 6 series) use a thermal reactor to meet emissions requirements and it would cook the head gaskets and heads.
a 528i is a pretty great ride if you are into the 80s bmw stuff. the one i had experience with desperately needed its shifter rebuilt (not the trans) which made it a little hard to shift (especially reverse) but it was a great car. we had many high school road trips with it.
i would probably pass on a 530 myself."

my friend who had the 528i gave it to her mother because she wanted a 3 series and got a 325e. at the time, it wasn't so bad, and you have to look at that market at the time...merkur xr4ti and maserati biturbo/425, mbz 190d/e, and the eh, cadillac cimarron. and that eta motor actually did get reasonable fuel economy at the time."

i always thought the caballero was something rare, but it appears it was actually the most popular buick wagon model in 1957 and 1958! they built 4456 of them in 1958.

i always thought it was an interesting style, and the 1957 version is downright beautiful. it's amazing to think that the '57 and '58 are from the same body shell.

when i see them up close at car shows though, they really don't seem all that practical or roomy inside. i'd be curious to know how much cargo area the things are rated at, but i think data like that from that far back is often sketchy. iirc, i think i read somewhere that the '57-59 mopar wagons had 95 cubic feet of cargo area.

as to the volvos, if a 17yo boy is going to have a car, a painfully slow brick on wheels with no semblance of sportiness, but built like a tank, sounds just about perfect. besides, a beater wagon could come in handy as a utility car when i needed one.

it all depends on the kid. i had one college roommate with an old 240 wagon with a couple hundred thousand miles on it, and he was quite proud of it. then there was this other roommate with one of the first nissan sentras, i believe, rusted to hell, nothing but seat covers over springs, etc, and he was also very proud of it. i think there is a certain gitchiness (spelling?) that goes with an old beater, and pride in the fact that you are brave enough to drive it just about anywhere.

i've got a whole list of high school buddies i remember were the same way, too. we'd get together and criticize those who drove new cars, courtesy of their folks, while sharing our ""i had to patch a fuel hose with duct tape to get home at 2 am"" stories."
5445,"August 15, 2006 6:35AM",andre1969,"and started driving, usually the kids with newer cars had something crappy and slow and tiny, like a lynx, civic, 4-cylinder mustang, tercel, chevette, cavalier, or something equally lame.

so by and large, at that time there was little pride to be had in having a newer car. i do remember there was this one goofy, pimply-faced kid with a high forehead who got a new trans am in his junior year. this would've been the 1985-86 school year, when i was a sophomore. it was black with gold trim/chicken, and pretty sharp looking. he became instantly cool, as i recall, when he got that car.

there was another kid in my class who drove a 1984 porsche 924. however, it was his parents and they didn't let him drive it often...usually he drove a cavalier.

my english teacher my senior year had a 1978 pontiac catalina, 2-tone burgundy with a 400. she was trying to sell it and only wanted $500 for it. i wanted that thing sooo badly, but my mom & stepdad wouldn't let me buy it. i guess my tastes haven't changed much over the years."

could be a good beater workhorse.

chrome bumper mgb that the seller is not asking the moon for.

seems fairly reasonable for a rare vehicle. knowing the miles would help.

here's one of those mx3s again. 4-cyl this time."
5449,"August 15, 2006 8:28AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i have nothing against giving a kid an older car...in fact...endorse that concept...but not a shabby beater (in this day and age). i mean, would you want someone's torn pants as a hand-me down? that's not the same as you buying your own funny pants in a thrift store.

and also, gentlemen, as enthusiasts, we have an obligation to provide the young and impressionable at least with a decent driving experience. a volvo wagon is about as cheerless and funless an experience as one could pack into a car. in hell we would all be forced to drive them.

at least with a volvo 144 sedan or coupe you had that long stickshift and a not seriously overweight car....and not being a wagon, you didn't have the tail wagging the dog around every turn."
5450,"August 15, 2006 8:30AM",british_rover,"what do you think of this.

http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/features/articleid=116481

i know before you had mentioned how a mg built in america by a chinese company would be a [non-permissible content removed] vehicle. would be interesting to hear your thoughts on it some more."
5451,"August 15, 2006 8:34AM",Mr_Shiftright,"alfa 164s --- yes, it does look like a stickshift---it had better be, as the automatics in those cars are dead in 30,000 miles (if you are lucky).

might be an okay buy at $1,500, but not for $3,000. ball joints, ac, brake calipers, electrica problems....this is going to start adding up. still for a fwd large sedan, it's fun to drive and the v6 engine sounds great when you romp on it. beware of leaking head gaskets, slow synchros, and a hard clutch pedal."
5452,"August 15, 2006 8:34AM",qbrozen,"a fun car just invites spirited driving, though.

it was bad enough that i figured out i could actually slide sideways a bit in my jeep with 33"" tires! then i found out what a vehicle with a low center of gravity could do when i hung a 180 in my merc zephyr! kids do stupid things when they first learn to drive. if the car has limitations (and is very cheap), the better off they will be, imho.

think of it like playing gran turismo. you start off with the cheap, slow, and poor handling cars while you learn the driving dynamics and track layouts, then you start winning races, then you start buying faster and more dynamic cars."

re: the new mg -- the ""suit"" in the interview likens mgs return to america in terms of the new mini's success, but this doesn't ring true to me. the new mini has a lot in common with the old mini, in terms of looks, driveline configuration, and even the accessories. there's a lot of historical reverence here.

the new mg has nothing to do with the old mg in any form. it won't look like it, drive like it, sound like it or even honor it. and while the mini inspired at least some consumer confidence by being made by bmw (confidence, as it turns out, not always justified), the new mg comes from.....china?

to me, the new mg is just a marketing concept with no connections whatsover to the old car...it's a ""badge rip-off"".

if it succeeds or fails, it won't have anything to do with the mg tradition one way or the other."
5457,"August 15, 2006 8:42AM",qbrozen,"aren't they still going to build the last generation of mgs, though? or did i get that wrong? i didn't think they would build whole new plants with whole new car designs, etc.

even if that's true, though, i guess that wouldn't matter much here in the us since most of the public hasn't seen an mg design since the 70s."
5458,"August 15, 2006 8:46AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i thought they were going to build that quasi-modern mg that came out a few years ago....but we'll see.

actually the last generation mg would be the worst possible choice if you think about it.

alfa 164s -- finding the right one at the right price is a lot of work for this type of car. most of them, being cheap to buy, have fallen into the wrong hands and are just about beyond redemption with too many needs. i'd rather see someone pay a premium price, even over blue book, for one that has been gone through by a specialist. a $5,000 or $6,000 ""overpriced"" 164 is way better than a bargain $2,500 one.

i'd like to have another one someday but not as a primary car."

i don't typically like the 944s, but i think (aside from those issues i just pointed out) its better looking than the one where the headlights and fenders were like one smooth piece ... what was that one? the 924? 928?

5464,"August 15, 2006 10:20AM",Mr_Shiftright,"well a stickshift coupe 240 would be a lot better than a wagon. i think the debate was not so much about it being a 240 wagon, but about it being a shabby 240 wagon....i mean, talk about rubbing it into a kid.

the black thing is a piece of normally clear plastic that was to protect the rear wheel flairs from rock chips and such. they usually crack and yellow over time. most of the time they just get removed. painting them black is clearly not the answer.

the car with the headlights flat in the top of the fender was the 928. some people love them, some hate them. i am somewhere in between. shifty recently sold his. i don't know how he felt about the looks of the car."

reminds me of years ago when i bought an old corolla from my mom's co worker. he lived in nyc, but had it registered in nj. well, comes the day he was supposed to bring it to the office so i could pick it up, and he can't locate the title. he had to take a day (maybe a half) off to drive to trenton to wait on lines to get a replacement.

actually, that is one of the cars i wished i kept longer. i even bought it sight unseen, based on how he described it to my mother (only asking $600 helped too). great little car, kept it a year and sold it for $900, only because i got a job post-college and couldn't wait to buy something new."

5485,"August 16, 2006 6:19AM",andre1969,"i like that '75 fury. even in brown. even as a 4-door sedan. normally i don't like brown cars, but that one doesn't really bother me. i always did like that front-end, with the quad headlights and the tall, fine grille. sometime in 1975 they went to a clumsy looking front-end with single headlights and a tall, rectangular turn signal. looked like this.

i'm not sure exactly how they transitioned over, but i think in 1974 they all had the quad headlights. then in 1975, plymouth took their midsize lineup and started calling it ""the new, small fury: the car a lot of people have been waiting for"". for 1975 they called all the big ones gran fury, but i think the top level was called brougham, and it had the goofy single headlights. then in '76-77 i think they all had the single headlights. for 1978 the line was dropped completely, along with the big dodge royal monaco, leaving only the chrysler newport/new yorker to carry on that final year with a slightly larger, heavier version of this body style.

in the earlier years, they offered a 2-door hardtop that i thought was pretty attractive. here's a pic of a 1974 dodge monaco, which is almost identical. unfortunately, in later years it seems that most of them were given that fixed opera window landau roof treatment like what that gran fury above with the single headlights is sporting.

dodge also did something similar to plymouth in 1975, offering an upscale version of the monaco called the royal monaco, which had a different front end with hidden headlights. it came off better looking than the gran fury's goofy treatment, though. for 1976, i think they all went to the hidden headlight treatment. then for 1977 i think they called all the big ones ""royal monaco"", while the midsized coronet got renamed as monaco, in a lame attempt to make you think that dodge was giving you two choices in ""full-sized"" cars...traditional and downsized. ford did something similar back then with the ltd and ltd-ii, which was a reskinned torino."

i remember it being the first car i had ever sat in with bucket seats (the nova and the reliant were bench seats), it had a backwards radio (the dials were on the opposite sides of what is thought to be conventional and rotated the opposite direction), and the shoulder harness was separate from the lap belt. oh and it had bias ply tires too.

5517,"August 17, 2006 5:17AM",andre1969,"one thing i always admired about the japanese small cars back then is that they found a way to make a hardtop with roll-down rear windows. i don't think the domestics ever offered anything that small as a hardtop. probably about the smallest detroit went was the corvair, early falcons, and early valiant/lancers. and maybe the rambler american? but those were all big cars compared to your typical japanese car.

i also thought it was interesting that the japanese held onto hardtop styling for a few years after the domestics did away with it. iirc, you could get a hardtop corolla, sapporo/challenger, mazda 626, datsun 200sx, and probably a few i'm forgetting, right up through 1983.

i think the last domestic hardtop was the 1978 newport/new yorker, offered both as a 4-door or 2-door (although the 2-door usually was optioned with a thick landau roof and fixed opera windows...yuck!)

there were cars without b-pillars, like the mark v, 1979-85 toro/riv/eldo, and 1980-83 cordoba/mirada, but they had fixed rear windows. and oddly, chrysler had the nerve to call my 1979 new yorker a ""pillared hardtop"", which is an oxymoron imo."

i actually prefer the '76 version, because i think the peaked fenders give the headlight area a bit of a swollen look, but if i had the garage space and the extra cash, i'd consider it. i like the color combo. sure, it screams 70's, but i think it wears it well.

i dunno why i'm on a mid-70's oldsmobile kick today, but i also like this 1975 delta 88 convertible. for some reason though, the delta convertible never turned me on in the same way that a '75 lesabre or caprice convertible does.

i think there's just something about the 1975 lesabre convertible that makes it seem sportier somehow than the delta of that era. maybe it's the more flowing lines, or the slightly wedge-shaped, somewhat menacing front-end, but i always liked 'em!"
5522,"August 17, 2006 9:05AM",qbrozen,"that ninety-eight looks to be in incredible shape.

unfortunately, the underhood of the delta 88 really takes away from the rest of the car.

when i see a well-preserved car, i like to see the condition reflected inside, outside, and underneath. there's nothing that turns me off more than a car that looks great on the outside, then you pop the hood and think you are looking at a completely different car."
5523,"August 17, 2006 9:31AM",Mr_Shiftright,"maybe you've gotten too used to today's dressed up engine compartments, most of which use slick engine covers and various shields to spiff them up.

your basic v-8 engine, as it comes out of detroit, is usually pretty ugly, very pedestrian and industrial looking. they would put them in '75 oldsmobiles or sell them to coal mines to pump water or something.

this is probably what spawned the aftermarket ""chrome thingie"" market. you needed to put a new suit on that lump of iron.

i always thought the italian engines were the prettiest---abundant use of aluminum and alloys and all kinds of artful bends to things."

5525,"August 17, 2006 9:40AM",andre1969,"yeah, but that '75 olds definitely needs some work in the engine compartment! i think the biggest problem is that it's been repainted and is all shiny on the outside, but under the hood it's faded, dusty, dirty, and a bit of rust here and there.

i've seen cars of this vintage, even ones with ""uglier"" engine compartments, that look much nicer when everything's cleaned and shined up.

they were all pretty messy by the 70's, but i think chrysler did the best job of the domestics when it comes to under-hood order. at least, when i look under the hood of my '79 new yorker, it looks like you can work under there more or less. i look under the hood of my '76 lemans and this helpless feeling just comes over me.

i wonder if part of it might be the suspensions? the coil springs of the lemans seem to cut up into the engine bay more than the nyer's torsion bars, which are lower and out of the way. pontiac also had a bad habit of putting the a/c compressor in the way so that it makes it a real pain to get to the front spark plug on the passenger-side, whereas on the mopars it seemed more out of the way. and gm cars had a bunch of crap for the hvac controls protruding out from the cowl on the passenger side in the engine bay, whereas i'm guessing on the mopars they got more of that stuff inside the passenger cabin?"

nice looking seville"
5546,"August 17, 2006 8:53PM",ghulet,"...i like the diplomatic 'i never cared for that design' you used when describing one of the ugliest (imo) cars on earth (the early valiants--take every full-size car styling mistake, most of which were made by chrysler to begin with, and apply them randomly to the 'new compact'). you're a class act for being so generous (i'm not being sarcastic)."
5547,"August 18, 2006 5:57AM",andre1969,"to admit this, but i really like that '75 toronado! :blush: in fact, i actually prefer them to the rivs and eldos of that timeframe. it's hard to put my finger on why, exactly...i'll admit they really aren't the most timelessly pretty car in the world. i think part of it might be that the '71-74 style was still a true hardtop, with roll-down rear windows. and i always liked the xs model with the wraparound rear window. and the low grille was always interesting i thought. even as a kid i really liked these.

i think the interiors were styled more nicely than the eldorados, too. the eldo always seemed kinda overdone and tacky on the inside to me. meanwhile the rivieras just didn't seem quite as luxurious. the toro just seemed better built than the eldo, too. one thing i've really noticed when looking at these cars up close, is that the rump of the toro is designed to have fewer separate pieces than the eldoorado, so there are fewer parts to not line up properly, and fewer gaps to be uneven.

i love that blue interior color on the toro, but i think the exterior blue would look better if it was metallic. i know i'm being picky here, but i absolutely love that shade on something like a '75 lesabre or caprice convertible, but on something more upscale like a toro, i think it needs to be metallic. if that thing was closer to me, i'd be all over it though!

as for that grand lemons, i like it alot. really pretty color. looks like it has cloth seats, which i don't see too often. usually these things had vinyl like mine does. oddly, i think the vinyl might have been the upgrade! first thing i'd do though is lose the fender skirts. gawd they make the car look fat! also wish they listed the engine. these things could have anything from a chevy 250-6 or olds 260 v-8 on up through a 350, 400, or 455. i dunno if they were putting chevy 305's in them yet.

1962 valiant...funny, but i always liked that 1960-62 style. i thought that the styling looked okay on the compacts, but it was when they tried to apply it to bigger cars where the styling fell apart. 1962-63 dodge/plymouth, for example. or to a lesser degree, the '61-63 imperial or '63-64 chryslers. i think chrysler's best looking car from 1962 was probably the dodge custom 880, which was just a '62 newport with a '61 the 2-door hardtop they offered in this style was interesting. i think it used the same roof as the 4-door sedan to save on costs. but then there was no way to make a single rear window go all the way down on something with a roofline that long, so they had to put in fixed quarter window at the back, and then a smaller roll-down window.

now a '60-62 valiant isn't something i lust over, but i do think they're kinda cool in a twisted sort of way. i think if i were forced to choose a compact from that era, i'd take one over a corvair or falcon. now compared to a '62 chevy ii, that might be a hard call.

as for ugliest car of all time, i think my vote would go to the 1961 plymouth!"

oh, and as for length, i have a used car book that lists these monsters at something like 227"" long. actually a couple inches longer than the eldorado! wheelbase was shorter though, something like 122"" compared to 126.3"". i wonder if the shorter wheelbase coupled with more overhang actually helps amplify the massive appearance of the car? i think the biggest offender in this category was actually the mark v. only 120.4"" in wheelbase, but ~230"" long overall, iirc."

i think if some car was totally shot and never had a snowball's chance in hell of being rescued, i'd just strip whatever was useful off of it and send the rest to be recycled. but otherwise, if i thought a car seemed semi-salvagable, i'd just let it sit indoors indefinitely.

as for an $800 beater, where i live it really wouldn't make that much sense here, because our winters aren't that bad, and whenever we get a real snowstorm we really don't have the infrastructure in place to deal with it. so for the most part we just close down and stay home! i just figure that with something like that $800 toronado, it would be a good chance for me to just get something like that, have some fun with it until it broke or i got bored with it, and then when i had to get rid of it i wouldn't be out too much money.

usually what i'd do though, is in the wintertime keep my $900 nyer off the road as much as possible, and let the intrepid take the abuse. i figure that since the nyer is old and doesn't have the rust protection that the intrepid does, i'd rather protect it. especially since i want to keep it for awhile, where in contrast i'm not trying to preserve the intrepid for posterity....just trying to keep it long enough to postpone a new(er) car payment for as long as possible!"

back when i was applying for the permit to get my garage built, they told me that i could have a coverage ratio, i think it was called, of 25%. meaning that the footprint of the house, driveway, sidewalks, patios, decks, and all outbuildings could be up to 25% of the total area of the yard.

so in theory i could have 1.07 acres of ""coverage"". which is about 46,600 square feet i think. doing a rough calculation, i think i currently have about 4400 square feet of coverage. about half of that is just for the gravel driveway. so if i really wanted to, it looks like i could build a few more garages. the garage i had built was 960 square feet. so theoretically, i could build about 43 more of them to use up the remaining 42000 square feet of coverage.

i wonder how many i could get away with before the county put their foot down? :shades:

one of my uncles bought a small ranch/farmette whatever you want to call it up near frederick, md about 10 or so years ago. it has a big 50x100 pole barn building on it with a big sliding door wide enough and tall enough to probably get a motorhome or tractor trailer in. i'd love to have something like that built!

5564,"August 18, 2006 10:33AM",benjaminh,"so many of these cars look like bottomless money pits.

but i like the bright red color that chrysler painted those slant six engines. my wife and i used to have a 1961 dodge lancer, the predecessor to the dart. it was bought new by her grandmother, and only had 40-50k on it when we were driving it in the early to mid-90s. that car had the best visibility of any car i've every been in--it was just panoramic. the interior room was great for the small exterior size too. it was really the best of the compact cars in terms of quality engineering, imho--way beyond a falcon or corvair or vw for that matter. the slant six had really good pickup with the pushbutton 2 speed (?) transmission. felt like you could get from 0-60 in about 13 seconds, although maybe it wasn't that fast. since it didn't have power steering or brakes, the interior of the engine compartment was a clean and almost empty thing of beauty, with that great red engine. when things broke on it though, like the winshield wiper, parts just did not seem available--not even in junkyards (i guess some parts were different from the more common dart).

just when our first child was born, in 1996, we decided to get rid of the car because it didn't have rear seatbelts for child seats. by chance someone walked by and offered us $2000 for it, even though we didn't have a for sale sign on it. i was thrilled, and wanted that money (which seemed way more than it was worth, even with the low miles), but my wife felt she had to offer it to her brother first. he's an engineer, built his own diesel engine for his truck, etc. he wanted the car, and so for the last ten years it's been sitting under a tarp near escalon, california. when he retires, perhaps he'll restore it.

problem with these things is what to you do with it except drag it from one freak show to another.

shifty says anything over $10,000, grab it. it ain't gonna get much better as time goes on and more things break. this is basically sale-proof, so any serious bid is a good bid."

but still, like shifty said, how many buyers are there for these things? and even though i think the ones i mentioned are way cool, if presented with the opportunity to buy one, i might still come to my senses before writing out the check!

if your only form of transportation was a hearse and you had to go to a funeral, would it be in poor taste to drive it in the procession? :shades:"
5572,"August 18, 2006 6:55PM",benjaminh,"that is in a way a dream/nightmare car for me. has anyone here watched 6 feet under? one of the main characters in that drives a 70s cadillac hearse that looks not that far off of this one at ebay:

awesome cargo capacity. you could sleep in it if it wouldn't creep you out too much. i think it would be a little creepy. i wonder if you can smell chemicals in it.

it's kind of the ultimate goth station wagon. the character who owned it (and hers was green) wrecks it in the second to last episode (i think). in the last episode she's driving a prius from la to ny.

what was that movie with...what were their names...bud cort and ruth gordon(?) i can't recall the name of the movie. but they used to hang out at funerals of people they didn't know. did one of them drive a hearse? haven't seen that movie since the 70s.

remember my little '83 datsun with the bad clutch master cyl?

well, i finally got the title yesterday and put plates on it properly... but i've been driving it off & on with the nc plates, just for the heck of it.

after about 50 miles or so -- over a period of 4 weeks -- the car started to sputter and run rough. completely out of the blue, while sitting there and idling.

won't take gas, won't stay on when warm, won't accelerate except with the slightest pressure on the throttle. to me, classic symptoms of running lean, and probably a partially clogged jet. so here i am with my $300 bargain, waiting for times that the missus isn't around so i can work on a car i don't need which i said i wouldn't do. great.

my mechanic said likely a ""varnish"" problem from sitting with low gas for 9 months. he recommended a ""power flush"" -- rev the engine w/ the air cleaner off, then plug the intake by covering with a clean towel. the engine produces a strong vacuum, and fuel is sucked out of the float bowl, and hopefully some junk with it.

a friend of mine said that sounded like a great idea, and that a buddy of his did something similarly clever and got a free helicopter ride to u of m hospital, skin grafts, and a medically induced coma to cirumvent the pain. i'm thinking i'll stay with cars from '91 and up.

ugh. and such a fun little truck otherwise.
my luck with cars hasn't been so great lately... the '96 milly is still running like a top [knock on wood, scratch a backstay].

i ended up breaking a water pump bolt off in the cover and not being able to get it back out. so then i had to buy a new timing chain cover."
5579,"August 19, 2006 10:37AM",Mr_Shiftright,"sounds like you might have a big vacuum leak somewhere. you can test for this by carefully squirting carb cleaner under the carb base or around vacuum lines (stay away from ignition wires obviously).

if not that, you might try this---cross two spark plug wires so that the car backfires through the carb when you try to start it..this sometimes blows debris out of the jets.

it's safe because you have the air cleaner on.

the '40 packard would be a good beater, but i wouldn't restore it. looks promising if cheap enough as a sunday ""ice cream car"" for the kids. clutch is easy although you might need a dockyard crane to lift the transmission.

the 560sl, if it ran well, might be a lot of car for not much $$$. the bad paint could be rectified by a $1,500 quickie paint job---these cars won't ever be collectible, so no harm done.

the following look like pieces of crap you don't want at any price:

galaxie convertible, '64 pontiac (sucks gas like you wouldn't believe!!)

56 cadillac is a dangerous buy---it's been sitting ten years and these cars are quite complex and not easy to work on. i'm divided on this car.

the rest are worthless to me...late mgbs are hideous to look at, deloreans are...well...'nuff said....'97 sho and eclipse are just hand grenades waiting for the pin to slip out.

5621,"August 22, 2006 9:06AM",andre1969,"about that '64 catalina? i admit i'd want to see more and better pics of it before i jumped on it. as for fuel economy, my '67 with a 400-4bbl will get about 17-18 on the highway. cr used to test catalinas with the 389 and 400-2bbl, and they usually got both better performance and better fuel economy than the fury/polara 318's, galaxie smallblocks, and impala smallblocks that they put them up against.

is there something about the '64 in particular? i actually prefer the '63 and '65 styling where the vertical headlights have a more aggressive thrust to them, but that '64 ain't bad. was pontiac still using that rotohydramatic/slim-jim or whatever it was called in '64? i don't think bonnevilles and star chief/executives, on the longer wheelbase, ever used that tranny, but catalinas and grand prixes, on the shorter wheelbase, did for a few years."
5622,"August 22, 2006 9:19AM",Mr_Shiftright,"there's just no upside in fixing up a ratty '64 pontiac with no exceptional features. it's not a 421 and it's not a calatina. world's best 2-door might sell for $12,000 in real world money. so a ratty one is just an old money pit. if someone wanted one, i'd suggest finding a clean survivor that doesn't need anything, or working on a convertible. these cars drive great and are comfortable.

as for gas mileage, i'd drop dead if a '64 bonneville got 18 mpg. i never personally met a 389 that didn't suck gas like a whale eats krill. but maybe the right driver on the right day on the right highway---anything is possible if you are hell-bent on it.

5641,"August 22, 2006 6:26PM",ghulet,"...though i cut and pasted, so i'm pretty sure it's the seller's mistake.

wbd1260371a129561 (i'm not looking at the last post).

let me see if i can figure anything out from my book."
5642,"August 22, 2006 6:28PM",ghulet,"...this probably doesn't interest you at this point, but it doesn't look too bad (of course, that's about the least revealing angle one can use for a picture), and damn, it's cheap:

perhaps an ideal parts car for somebody?"
5643,"August 22, 2006 6:29PM",british_rover,"yeah i am very curious to see what kind of shape it is on. this guys old disco was in very good shape till it got whacked pretty hard and it was only a few years newer then this range rover.
it didn't look like it did all that much damage to the body but it caused the transmission to die for some reason. was probably on its last legs already."

or, if anyone has access to carfax, apparently there are 9 entries on that vin (though the 10th digit, '1', indicates it's a 2001, which obviously is wrong). some mercedes sites advise that the 10th digit sometimes doesn't exist on euro cars, and to replace the 10th digit with an 'x', hence:

5646,"August 22, 2006 7:27PM",british_rover,don't have carfax at home but i could try it tomorrow if you guys want.
5647,"August 22, 2006 8:40PM",jlflemmons,"""ac doesn't work. i think it just needs freon..."". let's see now, it has been over 100d 19 of the last 21 days. if all that sucker needed was freon, the seller wouldn't be sweating his butt off, now would he?

""needs timing belt"". translation: belt was not serviced and snapped, bending valves and cracking heads.

and my favorite, ""reconditioned title"". right. i believe thats what the mb of earlier posts has. a reconditioned title to go along with the multiple donors. come to think of it, maybe that's why the vin isn't coming up. it is a compilation of the cars used to build the one for sale!"
5648,"August 23, 2006 3:02AM",qbrozen,"'89 vette that needs a paint job for 5.5k? seems a tad high. try $3,500. nobody wants a c4 unless it's a convertible, maybe. you can buy a spiff coupe for $9k so what's the point---well, i guess you could miracle it for $1,500 and then you're in $7k....but what have you got here?

interesting. i certainly don't want a c4 myself. heck, i don't even want a c5, unless its a z06. but i never see cheap vettes around here, regardless. so, really, i think compared to the asking prices he is seeing in his area, he's pretty fair. i dunno. i certainly could be wrong. i never shop for these, that's for sure."
5649,"August 23, 2006 3:05AM",qbrozen,"i thought 99s rusted in joisey?

everything rusts here eventually ... but '99 is way too soon. not to mention i expect later model cars to last longer in the rust belt. i kinda get the feeling there is accident history behind this rust. a non-factory original hood/paint job would probably not last as long out here."
5650,"August 23, 2006 3:10AM",qbrozen,"ok, so someone around the corner from me put a pretty handsome car out for sale, but i have no idea what it is. my first instinct said lincoln, but the nose doesn't seem quite right.

its overall very similar to this:
http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/71-lincoln-mark-iii-very-straight-clean-survivor_- - - w0qqitemz320020318008qqihz011qqcategoryz6305qqrdz1qqcmdzviewitem

but, on this car, the headlights are 4 round lights with no covers (unless they are just not closed) and the center grille is straight across in the front (not a v-shape like this one). i also don't believe it has the tire carrier out back.

any thoughts?"
5651,"August 23, 2006 5:25AM",british_rover,didn't thunderbirds of that era also share the lincoln mark series chassis??
5652,"August 23, 2006 5:32AM",andre1969,"i wonder if that '66 valiant is actually one of those canadian chrysler valiants? iirc, they didn't sell plymouths in canada back then (or ever, maybe?) but for some reason they felt the urge to take the dodge dart and sell it as the chrysler valiant.

the price is definitely an eye opener. if it were closer i'd actually be tempted to look at it. i remember about 13 years ago, there was a local guy with a running '65 plymouth valiant 2-door sedan, total stripper except for the larger 225 slant six and torqueflite automatic. didn't even have a radio. it was originally a pale blue, but had been brush-painted this color that looked like a combination of burnt charcoal and mud. but hey, he would've let it go for 50 bucks! i was tempted, but back then an additional car meant about $500-600 per year more in insurance, and i had just gotten out of college and wasn't working full time yet."
5653,"August 23, 2006 5:40AM",andre1969,"didn't thunderbirds of that era also share the lincoln mark series chassis??

i was thinking thunderbird too, but back then the t-birds that were on the same platform either had hidden headlights (the earlier ones) or had a beaky front-end, courtesy of the same guy who started that trend a few years earlier at pontiac, semon ""bunkie"" knudsen.

now the earlier 1967 or so t-birds are flat-faced, and look like this with the headlight covers open.

back in the late 60's, before they went to hidden headlights and got too neoclassically pimpy, lincolns in general had a fairly flat, clean front-end. the continental (non mark) coupe looked like this

for 1972-76 the t-bird was practically a clone of the mark iv. here's 1972 t-bird"
5654,"August 23, 2006 7:08AM",qbrozen,"definitely none of those.

i need to drive by it again. i was browsing through ebay this morning, and i could not find anything else that was as close as the lincoln i posted, so maybe it does have those details and i was just driving too fast to take it all in properly."
5655,"August 23, 2006 7:43AM",Mr_Shiftright,"i agree, it would be a fair price -- if it didn't need a paint job. but it costs at least $5,000 to paint a car decently these days, so my feeling is why not just buy one all painted without having been in an accident? the c4 might be a lot of performance for the $$$, but it's a pretty nasty car to drive everyday and not terribly durable externally (powertrain is great). the c5 is so much better. you have to remember they made a lot of corvettes every year, so these cars, especially when old, are a dime a dozen, and they generally don't age well."
5656,"August 23, 2006 7:45AM",Mr_Shiftright,"carfax-- be real careful of carfax---i have found *many* cars that were badly damaged in the past and there was no record whatsoever of this damage on carfax. recently researched a ferrari modena that had sustained frame damage, and it showed clean on carfax. so that would have been an awful mistake, to buy that car based on what carfax said."
5657,"August 23, 2006 7:56AM",british_rover,"yeah i have seen a few cars that i know were hit, either the customer told me so or i could just see the repair work, and they did not show up on carfax.

i have noticed this more often recently then in the past do you think carfax is maybe letting more vehicles slip through the cracks."
5658,"August 23, 2006 8:38AM",lemmer,"i could be wrong, but i don't think anyone is under any obligation to report to carfax. i think most insurance companies report stuff, but a lot of car repairs (especially minor damage) bypass insurance.

carfax is just a starting point in the search for accident or other damage to a car."
5659,"August 23, 2006 10:26AM",qbrozen,"i also could be wrong, but i think insurance companies don't report anything. i thought i heard or read that carfax gets their info from dmv, who i think, in return, works off of police reports?? maybe?? so, in other words, no police report, no carfax record??"
5660,"August 23, 2006 10:28AM",Mr_Shiftright,"oh i have personally researched vehicles i knew had major wrecks that weren't on carfax. aside from that ferrari with $32,000 in frame damage, there was a '95 miata that had been hit three times with a total of $22,000 damage, and a '96 bmw that had been in two accidents with $18,000 damage or so.

so we aren't talking minor fender benders here. carfax is better than nothing but if you assume it's the end all and be all, you could be very very wrong."
5661,"August 23, 2006 10:29AM",qbrozen,"ah. right from the carfax site.

accident data:
damage reports from accidents (selected states only)
police-reported detail

so there has to be an accident report. personally, i've never filled out an accident report."
5662,"August 23, 2006 10:31AM",Mr_Shiftright,i do know that that ferrari had an accident report (i saw it) and it was a no show on carfax.
5663,"August 23, 2006 10:32AM",qbrozen,"must not be in one of those ""selected states.""

at least, that's the answer you'd probably get from carfax reps."
5664,"August 23, 2006 10:34AM",british_rover,my old discovery demo was a frame damaged and tmu car that did not show up on carfax when we first got it. it was not till months later that all of a sudden all of this additional info popped up.
5665,"August 23, 2006 11:20AM",qbrozen,"i'd be hard pressed to come up with a scarier scenario than buying a german car that the owner believes is ""maintenance free.""

whaddya mean i gotta change the oil? its maintenance free!"
5666,"August 23, 2006 11:26AM",qbrozen,"this seller has been listing these same 3 cars for weeks and has not dropped his price even $1. (i think i posted the benzes a while back).

'88 caprice

'88 300e

'84 300d"
5667,"August 23, 2006 11:31AM",andre1969,"it's hard to tell from the small pics, but other than the dent on the front fender that '88 caprice doesn't look bad. and on the inside, either there's a shadow on it or the driver's seat bottom cushion looks dingy/stained. i wonder what all is *really* wrong with it? :shades:"
5668,"August 23, 2006 11:43AM",lemmer,"as it turns out, i had no idea what i was talking about.

i wonder which states are included."
5669,"August 23, 2006 11:44AM",qbrozen,"ok ... i don't wanna exactly be sexist ... but what women does this guy know?? i ever tell ya about my sis driving her car for days with a noise before coming to me to ask me to take a look at it ... the noise was the valves tapping from having almost no oil!! or how about my wife who can't even tell me when her last oil change was? or says things like ""some red or yellow light has been flashing on the dash since yesterday. what's it for?""

looks to be in nice shape. but, what is that? maybe double fair value?

this could have been stored in a climate-controlled garage for 20 years and it still wouldn't be worth the asking price!

aha! an actual project we can discuss! so what do you guys think?"
5670,"August 23, 2006 11:48AM",andre1969,"to properly pull off the look and i never let my hair get long enough to slick it back, but for some twisted reason i like that '87 firebird! only way i'd ever get into one is if it's a v-8 model, and even then, with my height and my back problems, i doubt it would be very useful to me."
5671,"August 23, 2006 12:21PM",lilengineerboy,"the guy with the 318 is hosed because a 325 *shouldn't* be more expensive enough not to get the beautiful smooth 6. also he mentions how low maintenance it is and then says its been rebuilt.
the 325i looked okay, just priced unrealistically. i don't understand when private sellers ask more than edmunds tmv retail.
the 325 ""project"" is an es not an is. the es has the eta motor with a 4500 rpm redline. great for longevity, you're never going to float the valves at 4500 rpm, and those pistons have gone up and down about half as many times as in an i motor, but eh, not so speedy.
its comfortable enough to drive to work and stuff, and gets reasonable fuel economy, but not a whole lot else going for it."
5672,"August 23, 2006 12:26PM",qbrozen,"interesting info. what exactly is an eta motor?

4500 redline? ugh! i think i'm no longer interested.

now ... lemme get my bimmer terminology straight ... es and is are coupes? just an i means sedan?"
5673,"August 23, 2006 12:31PM",qbrozen,"oh. never mind. i found this page:
http://www.pelicanparts.com/bmw/techarticles/jf-tech/bmw_designation_faq.htm

so coupe and sedan aren't actually designated by the letters. seems odd."
5674,"August 23, 2006 12:49PM",lilengineerboy,"well, yes and no. the e30 and e36 (84-91 and 92-~98) 3 series bmws have an s for coupe designation and c for convertible. hence a 325i is a sedan and a 325is is a coupe while a 325ic is a convertible. come to think of it, i think the is was an option package on the coupe although i have never seen an i coupe that didn't have the s. i think it was '87 where they dropped the 'e' and it was just 325. the 325xi was awd, and i don't know if the coupe was the 325xis or not.
for the e46s, i am still all mixed up too.
clear as mud?"
5675,"August 23, 2006 1:23PM",xwesx,"i love how the owner touts the ""reliability"" of this car, then the last statement in the ad is this:

miles 50,000 on rebuilt

uh-huh. :lemon:"
5676,"August 23, 2006 1:26PM",qbrozen,"hmmmm... well, how bout this '85 318i coupe(note the lack of an s)?

or this '85 325e coupe?

there's lots of those examples. however, so far, i'm unable to find a 4-door with the s. hmmmmm...."
5677,"August 23, 2006 1:33PM",qbrozen,"found this one during my ebay search for this designation mystery.

high miles, but it seems priced right so far.

unfortunate seats, though. set of recaros would take care of that."
5678,"August 23, 2006 1:57PM",lilengineerboy,"sorry its just the e36 that follows that designation. for e30s, the ""s"" was an option package on coupes (m-level seats, steering wheel and shifter and an ""aero"" kit)"

maybe i should start investing in some mouse traps for my garage? so far the only critters that have really invaded it are wasps, ants, spiders, and lizards. the wasps pretty much fry themselves in the window sills and i think the spiders and ants kinda keep each other in check. and i think the lizards are kinda cool. i have no idea what the ants are finding that's so interesting...maybe sap from the fairly fresh lumber?"

http://www.waukeganautoauction.com/inventory_show.asp?stknum=l7279&show=6

i mean, it is very nice for what it is, but come on...that price is a bit silly. still, i'd rather have it with that engine than the 450 (this is a 280se, not a 380 as is stated once). they did also have a 380se ('85), in pretty decent shape, with the all-126-made-in-the-early-80s silver with blue (or was it black?) leather, hardly any rust, straight, not messed with, really a bit nicer than most i see (which is less and less often). that one was $1750....hmmm.

other cars they had on the lot:
*'83-ish pop-up headlight toyota celica gts coupe (non-hatch with the spectraman taillights, i actually like these better than the hatch), kinda ratty but only $1000-1100, iirc.
*the saddest maserati biturbo coupe i've ever seen, red with tan and black painted rockers, probably not factory (and probably to hide the rust, which had attacked the trunk), and to match....
*the nastiest bmw 633csi i've ever seen, with a big dent on the left front fender (really, no straight panels), faded red-orange paint (probably factory, though), strange add-on rear headrests (as if the sightlines on that thing weren't bad enough) and the added bonus make-people-think-it's-an-89 bmw alloys (from a 525i, kinda flat)....this car was probably an '81 or so (couldn't tell), i think they wanted like $1150 for it
*a very nice looking mustard-colored fj land cruiser (i think a '75), no price (wondering what these go for)."

when i was in school a local lot had a euro model 116 280se, with cloth interior and a 5-speed! it was red with an odd checked cloth upholstery pattern, and it looked quite nice. they wanted something like 3k for it, and it was gone relatively fast."

(large enough to sleep in, hence the name ""traveller"")

as i recall it had a strange 2-spd, semi-automatic transmission (lift off the throttle to shift) and, yes shifty, very heavy steering.

by the time that i got my driver's license, it had been replaced by a 1957 fireflight 4-dr, which i thought was way cooler.

5730,"August 25, 2006 2:33PM",andre1969,"i always wondered...how were those things without power steering? my granddad had a '53 desoto firedome but it had power steering. i never got a chance to drive it because he sold it a few months before i got my learner's permit. i know they at least change the ratio on the steering when it's nonpower, so instead of being like 3.3 turns from lock to lock, it's more like 4.7 or so?

would it be any worse than, say, a 1968 dart v-8 with a broken power steering pump? the tighter ratio, coupled with the drag of the non-functioning power stuff, ensured that i had some pretty toned arm muscles...until i got it fixed. and until i stopped going to the gym regularly, and got a desk job. :blush:"
5731,"August 25, 2006 2:39PM",andre1969,"cool...your parents had a '57 fireflite? got any pics of it? i have a '57 firedome.

as for that semi-automatic transmission, my granddad's '53 firedome had it. the way he explained it to me, it actually had 4 forward gears. when you started off you depressed the clutch and could put it into either low or high. in low, it would use either first or second, and would shift as needed between the two. if you wanted to go into high you had to press the clutch and then shift. then it would shift as needed, between third and fourth. if you wanted, you could start off in high, but acceleration was tedious. now i dunno if that's how it worked or not. granddad got rid of that car 20 years ago, and he passed away 16 years ago, so my memory could be fuzzy!"

5734,"August 25, 2006 3:05PM",oregonboy,"whoa! that's right, andre. now that you mention it, i remember that it did have a clutch and and automatic shift (how bizarre is that?!) i can remember now, my dad trying to teach me to drive that thing... starting in low range shifting manually into high range then doing the ""lift throttle to shift thing"" to get into top gear. way too much to think about for a first-time driver.

as for the desoto, i've admired the pics you've posted of your red/white two-door... a very handsome example of extreme mopar styling. ours was not so pretty, as it wore a monotone navy-blue, earl schibe paint job. i'll check to see if my mom has any pictures next time i see her. she lives out-of-state, so it could be a while.

that's how my dart was. not bad once you got it moving, but parallel parking was, umm, interesting. one of my buddies took his driver's test in it. first time he failed immediately and the cop who went out with him had to drive it all the way back. my buddy said the cop was griping up a storm about my car! he did finally pass with it, though.

it was one of those cars though where you really had to keep it moving while you turned the wheels. if you were completely stopped and tried to turn them, it would give you a workout. my granddad taught me at a young age though, to coordinate it so i was turning the wheels and moving at the same time, because he hated the holes i was drilling in the gravel driveway!"
5736,"August 25, 2006 5:58PM",wevk,"many years ago a fellow up the street had a early 50s chrysler without power steering. for amusement, while driving slowly, he would grab the wheel and yank it hard in one direction. this which would set the car to rocking while the steering wheel sawed back and forth wildly on it's own. this technique had an element of danger as that wheel had the potential to tear your arm off.

porsche 944 turbo -- car looks great, price is good, and he's done the 3 tortures for a 944---the transmission/clutch, water pump and timing belt...so you're good to go for many k miles now. i'd definitely grab that car, it's a good deal sounds like.

72 skylark -- it's not a gs, so it's a nothing car. certainly not worth a restoration.

67 mustang---sure, you can put a v-8 in easily. just order up a crate engine and plop. not a problem. most people do this, especially with a 6 cylinder automatic, where the whole thing is a lot easier than installing a 4 speed. however, this car has rust, and so the price is not justified at all.

70 skylark--beware the vinyl roof; check for rust under the ""peeling"". these roofs like to trap water."

5743,"August 26, 2006 9:42AM",gsemike,"i think that both of those skylarks are destined to be high school hot rods. often, a father and son combo will spruce a car like that up when the kid is 14 or 15. not worth a restore, but maybe a used engine and a maaco paint job, and the kid will think that he's the king of the road. maybe if the not running car could be had for half the ask, and the running one were $2500, you could end up with an ok beater for 5 grand-ish.

looking again at the t-type, the before body damage pics have some sort of ugly 80s period rim on it, and the after has an old buick rally. while the body damage isn't severe, let's assume that front wheel got cracked and take a close close look at the suspension and frame.

i didn't notice the rust on the mustang. i think that what we've got here is a collection of beaters that can be fun but not anything to dump alot of dough in to."
5744,"August 26, 2006 10:23AM",Mr_Shiftright,"the mustang said something about rust, then about floor repair, then about upper shock mount rust repair, and then i just said ""uh-oh"" and left the building.

yeah i suppose you could put some flowmasters on an old skylark and get miracle to take a broom to it and paint it, why not? harmless cheap fun.

beaters: what we are witnessing here today is the winnowing or culling process by which certain old cars live or die over a certain period of time. those deemed worthy will be saved, and the rest get driven into the dirt and then mostly scrapped or picked over by the scavengers of the automotive serengti....

thus most '70 plain-jane skylarks will die, while all '70 chevelle 2-doors will be saved if they can be. why that is the way it is, hard to say. part myth, part styling, part the buyers voting with their wallets."
